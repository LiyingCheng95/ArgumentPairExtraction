The authors propose in this paper to complement the node attributes in a graph with vectors obtained using a graph embedding algorithm.	Review	O	0
More precisely, they propose a graph neural network that apply several layers of graph convolution in parallel to the node attributes and to the embedding, then takes an average of the result, which is fed to another series of graph convolution.	Review	O	0
This is combined with some form of sampling which strongly resembles median based quantization but is solved with some basic heuristics and without acknowledging the resemblance (I might be missing something).	Review	B	3
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Globally, I find this paper very unclear.	Review	O	0
The authors are mixing references to graph convolution for fixed graph structure with references about general graph neural networks.	Review	B	1
Their goal is not clearly stated from the beginning and in many places the discussion lacks of focus and is difficult to follow.	Review	I	2
In the experimental evaluation several values are very close one to another and the statistical significativity of the differences is not assessed.	Review	I	4

But, the spatial graph convolution used in all the scenarios is similar.	Reply	B	1
Specifically, we used spatial convolution expressed in eq (1) as our convolution function.	Reply	I	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2- ‚Äútheir goal is not clearly stated - I find this paper very unclear‚Äù:[line_break_token]In abstract and in section 3, the goal of the paper is explained with illustrative examples.	Reply	O	0
In addition, several novel experiments are presented which showcase the importance of the proposed approach (Table 1 and Table 2).	Reply	B	2
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]3- ‚ÄúIn the experimental evaluation several values are very close one to another‚Äù[line_break_token]In Table 1 and Table 2, it is shown that the improvement in the performance of the GNN is significant when the proposed approach is utilized.
