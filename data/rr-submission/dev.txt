This paper describes a first working approach for fully unsupervised neural machine translation.	O	O	Review	394
The core ideas being this method are: (1) train in both directions (French to English and English to French) in tandem; (2) lock the embedding table to bilingual embeddings induced from monolingual data; (3) share the encoder between two languages; and (3)  alternate between denoising auto-encoder steps and back-translation steps.	O	O	Review	394
The key to making this work seems to be using a denoising auto-encoder where noise is introduced by permuting the source sentence, which prevents the encoder from learning a simple copy operation.	O	O	Review	394
The paper shows real progress over a simple word-to-word baseline for WMT 2014 English-French and English-German.	O	O	Review	394
Preliminary results in a semi-supervised setting are also provided.	O	O	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This is solid work, presenting a reasonable first working system for unsupervised NMT, which had never been done before now.	O	O	Review	394
That alone is notable, and overall, I like the paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	394
The work shares some similarities with He et al‚Äôs NIPS 2016 paper on ‚ÄúDual learning for MT,‚Äù but has more than enough new content to address the issues that arise with the fully unsupervised scenario.	I-Review	I-1	Review	394
The work is not perfect, though.	I-Review	I-1	Review	394
I feel that the paper‚Äôs abstract over-claims to some extent.	I-Review	I-1	Review	394
Also, the experimental section shows clearly that in getting the model to work at all, they have created a model with a very real ceiling on performance.	O	O	Review	394
However, to go from not working to working a little is a big, important first step.	O	O	Review	394
Also, I found the paper‚Äôs notation and prose to be admirably clear; the paper was very easy to follow.	O	O	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding over-claiming, this is mostly an issue of stylistic preference, but this paper‚Äôs use of the term ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù in both the abstract and the conclusion grates a little.	B-Review	B-1	Review	394
This is a solid first attempt at a new task, and it lays a strong foundation for others to build upon, but there is lots of room for improvement.	I-Review	I-1	Review	394
I don‚Äôt think it warrants being called a breakthrough - lots of papers introduce new tasks and produce baseline solutions.	I-Review	I-1	Review	394
I would generally advise to let the readers draw their own conclusions.	I-Review	I-1	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding the ceiling, the authors are very up-front about this in Table 1, but it bears repeating here: a fully supervised model constrained in the same way as this unsupervised model does not perform very well at all.	B-Review	B-2	Review	394
In fact, it consistently fails to surpass the semi-supervised baseline (which I think deserved some further discussion in the paper).	I-Review	I-2	Review	394
The poor performance of the fully supervised model demonstrates that there is a very real ceiling to this approach, and the paper would be stronger if the authors were able to show to what degree relaxing these constraints harms the unsupervised system and helps the supervised one.	I-Review	I-2	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The semi-supervised experiment in Sections 2.3 and 4 is a little dangerous.	B-Review	B-3	Review	394
With BLEU scores failing to top 22 for English-French, there is a good chance that a simple phrase-based baseline on the same 100k sentence pairs with a large target language model will outperform this technique.	I-Review	I-3	Review	394
Any low-resource scenario should include a Moses baseline for calibration, as NMT is notoriously weak with small amounts of parallel data.	I-Review	I-3	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally, I think the phrasing in Section 5.1 needs to be softened, where it states, ‚Äú... it is not possible to use backtranslation alone without denoising, as the initial translations would be meaningless sentences produced by a random NMT model, ...‚Äù This statement implies that the system producing the sentences for back-translation must be a neural MT system, which is not the case.	B-Review	B-4	Review	394
For example, a related paper co-submitted to ICLR, called ‚ÄúUnsupervised machine translation using monolingual corpora only,‚Äù shows that one can prime back-translation with a simple word-to-word system similar to the word-to-word baseline in this paper‚Äôs Table 1.	I-Review	I-4	Review	394
Thanks for the insightful feedback.	O	O	Reply	394
Please find our answers below:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Regarding over-claiming, it was not our intention to exaggerate our contribution, and we in fact share your view on this: we think that our work is a strong foundation for a new and exciting research direction in NMT, but we agree that it is only a first step and there is still a long way to go.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	394
We understand that ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù might not be the most appropriate term for this, and we have removed it from the revised version of the paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- We find the discussion on the ceiling very interesting and relevant.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	394
We agree on the following key observations: 1) the comparable supervised system can be seen as a ceiling for the unsupervised system, and 2) the comparable supervised system gets relatively poor results.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
As such, one might conclude that our approach has a hard limit in this ceiling, as any eventual improvement in the proposed training method could at best close the gap with it.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
However, this also assumes that the ceiling itself is fixed and cannot be improved, which we do not find to be the case.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
In fact, we think that a very interesting research direction is to identify and address the factors that limited the performance of the comparable supervised system, which should also translate in an improvement for the unsupervised system.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
We have the following ideas in this regard, which we have better described in the revised version of the paper:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) We did not perform any rigorous hyperparameter exploration, and we favored efficiency over performance in our experimental design.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
As such, we think that there is a considerable margin to improve our results with some engineering effort, such as using larger models, longer training times, ensembling techniques and better decoding strategies (length/coverage penalty).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) While the constraints that we introduce to make our unsupervised system trainable might also limit its performance, one could design a multi-phase training procedure where these constraints are progressively relaxed.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
For instance, a key aspect of our design is to use fixed cross-lingual embeddings in the encoder.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
This is necessary in the early stages of training, as it forces the encoder to use a common word representation for both languages, but it might also limit what it can ultimately learn in the process.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
For that reason, one could start to progressively update the weights of the encoder embeddings as training progresses.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
Similarly, one could also decouple the shared encoder into two independent encoders at some point during training, or progressively reduce the noise level.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Regarding the semi-supervised experiments, note that our point here was not to improve the state of the art under these conditions, but rather to prove that the proposed system can also exploit a (relatively) small parallel corpus, showing its potential interest beyond the strictly unsupervised scenario.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Our statement that ‚Äúit is not possible to use backtranslation alone without denoising‚Äù was referring to our training procedure where backtranslation uses the model from the previous iteration.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	394
It is true that it does not apply to the general case, as backtranslation could also be used in conjunction with other translation methods (e.g. embedding nearest neighbor), and we have consequently softened the statement in the revised version as suggested	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	394

unsupervised neural machine translation[line_break_token][line_break_token]This is an interesting paper on unsupervised MT.	O	O	Review	394

[line_break_token][line_break_token]All though none of these ideas are new, they haven‚Äôt been combined in this way before, and that what‚Äôs novel here.	O	O	Review	394
The paper is essentially a neat application of (1), and is an empirical/ systems paper.	O	O	Review	394
It‚Äôs essentially a proof-of-concept that it is that it‚Äôs possible to get anything at all using no parallel data.	O	O	Review	394
That‚Äôs surprising and interesting, but I learned very little else from it.	O	O	Review	394
The paper reads as preliminary and rushed, and I had difficulty answering some basic questions:[line_break_token][line_break_token]* In Table (1), I‚Äôm slightly puzzled by why 5 is better than 6, and this may be because I‚Äôm confused about what 6 represents.	B-Review	B-1	Review	394
It would be natural to compare 5 with a system trained on 100K parallel text, since the systems would then (effectively) differ only in that 5 also exploits additional monolingual data.	I-Review	I-1	Review	394
But the text suggests that 6 is trained on much more than 100K parallel sentences; that is, it differs in at least two conditions (amount of parallel text and use of monolingual text).	I-Review	I-1	Review	394
Since this paper‚Äôs primary contribution is empirical, this comparison should be done in a carefully controlled way, differing each of these elements in turn.	I-Review	I-1	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* I‚Äôm very confused by the comment on p. 8 that ‚Äúthe modifications introduced by our proposal are also limiting‚Äù to the ‚Äúcomparable supervised NMT system‚Äù.	B-Review	B-2	Review	394
According to the paper, the architecture of the system is unchanged, so why would this be the case?	I-Review	I-2	Review	394
This comment makes it seem like something else has been changed in the baseline, which in turn makes it somewhat hard to accept the results here.	I-Review	I-2	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Comment:[line_break_token]* The qualitative analysis is not really an analysis: it‚Äôs just a few cherry-picked examples and some vague observations.	B-Review	B-3	Review	394
While it is useful to see that the system does indeed generate nontrivial content in these cases, this doesn‚Äôt give us further insight into what the system does well or poorly outside these examples.	I-Review	I-3	Review	394
The BLEU scores suggest that it also produces many low-quality translations.	I-Review	I-3	Review	394
What is different about these particular examples? (	I-Review	I-3	Review	394
Aside: since the cross-lingual embedding method is trained on numerals, should we be concerned that the system fails at translating numerals?)	I-Review	I-3	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Questions:[line_break_token]* Contrastive estimation considers other neighborhood functions (‚Äúrandom noise‚Äù in the parlance of this paper), and it‚Äôs natural to wonder what would happen if this paper also used these or other neighborhood functions.	B-Review	B-4	Review	394
More importantly, I suspect the the neighborhood functions are important: when translating between Indo-European languages as in these experiments, local swaps are reasonable; but in translating between two different language families (as would often be the case in the motivating low-resource scenario that the paper does not actually test), it seems likely that other neighborhood functions would be important, since structural differences would be much larger.	I-Review	I-4	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Presentational comments (these don‚Äôt affect my evaluation, they‚Äôre mostly observations but they contribute to a general feeling that the paper is rushed and preliminary):[line_break_token][line_break_token]* BPE does not ‚Äúlearn‚Äù, it‚Äôs entirely deterministic.	B-Review	B-5	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* This paper is at best tangentially related to decipherment.	B-Review	B-6	Review	394
Decipherment operates under two quite different assumptions: there is no training data for the source language ciphertext, only the ciphertext itself (which is often very small); and the replacement function is deterministic rather than probabilistic (and often monotonic).	I-Review	I-6	Review	394
The Dou and Knight papers are interesting, but they‚Äôre an adaptation of ideas rather than decipherment per se.	I-Review	I-6	Review	394
Since none of those ideas are used here this feels like hand-waving.	I-Review	I-6	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Future work is vague: ‚Äúwe would like to detect and mitigate the specific causes‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúwe also think that a better handling of rare words‚Ä¶‚Äù That‚Äôs great, but how will you do these things?	B-Review	B-7	Review	394
Do you have specific reasons to think this, or ideas on how to approach them?	I-Review	I-7	Review	394
Otherwise this is just hand-waving.	I-Review	I-7	Review	394
Thanks for the insightful review.	O	O	Reply	394
We have tried to make the paper more clear in the revised version taking these comments into account.	O	O	Reply	394
Please find the answers to each specific point below:[line_break_token][line_break_token]General:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- To clarify what the semi-supervised and supervised systems represents in Table 1: (5) is the same as (4), but in addition to training on monolingual corpora using denoising and backtransaltion, it is also trained in a subset of 100K parallel sentences using standard supervised cross-entropy loss (it alternates one mini-batch of denoising, one mini-batch of backtranslation and one mini-batch of  this supervised training). (	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	394
6) is the same as (5) except for two differences: 1) it uses the full parallel corpus instead of the subset of 100K parallel sentences, and 2) it does not use any monolingual corpora nor denoising or backtranslation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	394
We think that the main reason why (5) is better than (6) is related to the domain: the parallel corpus of (6) is general, whereas the subset of 100K parallel sentences and the monolingual corpus used for (5) are in the news domain just as the test set.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	394
While these facts were already mentioned in the paper, the new version includes a more detailed discussion.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	394
At the same time, we agree that the fact that the comparable system differs from the semi-supervised system in two aspects makes the comparison more difficult, and we are currently working to extend our experiments accordingly.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Regarding the comment that ‚Äúthe modifications introduced by our proposal are also limiting‚Äù to the ‚Äúcomparable supervised NMT system‚Äù, note that, as discussed in the previous point, the comparable NMT system uses the exact same architecture and hyperparameters as the unsupervised system (number of layers, hidden units, attention model etc.)	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	394
and, as such, it also incorporates the non-standard variations in Section 3.1 (dual structure using a shared encoder with fixed embeddings).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
These are what we were referring to as ‚Äúthe modification introduced by our proposal‚Äù, but the only difference between the unsupervised and the supervised systems is that, instead of training in monolingual corpora using denoising and backtranslation, we train in parallel corpora just as in standard NMT.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
We have tried to make this more clear in the revised version of the paper.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Comment:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- We agree that the qualitative analysis in the current version is limited.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	394
It was done mainly to check and illustrate that the proposed unsupervised NMT system generates sensible translations despite the lack of parallel corpora.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	394
We believe that a more detailed investigation and analysis into the properties and characteristics of translation generated by unsupervised NMT must be conducted in the future.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Note that we only use shared numerals to initialize the iterative embedding mapping method, so it is understandable that the system fails to translate numerals after the training of both the embedding mapping and the unsupervised NMT system itself.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	394
While it would certainly be possible to perform an ad-hoc processing to translate numerals under the assumption that they are shared by different languages, our point was to show that the system has some logical adequacy issues for very similar concepts (e.g. different numerals or month names).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Questions:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Thanks for pointing out the connection with contrastive estimation, which is now properly discussed in the revised version of the paper.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	394
As for the role of neighborhood functions, we agree that there are many possible choices beyond local swaps, and the optimal choice could greatly depend on the typological divergences between the languages involved.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	394
In this regard, we think that this is a very interesting direction to explore in the future, and we have tried to better discuss this matter in the revised version of the paper.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Having said that, please note that we have considered two language pairs (English-French and English-German) in our experiments.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	394
Despite being indo-european, there are important properties that distinguish these language pairs, such as the verb-final construction and the prevalence of compounding in German in contrast to French.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	394
In fact, English-German has often been studied in machine translation as a particularly challenging language pair.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	394
For that reason, we believe that the experiments on these two distinct language pairs support the effectiveness of the proposed approach, despite the potential for future investigation on the effect of contrastive functions on the choice of language pairs	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	394

The authors present a model for unsupervised NMT which requires no parallel corpora between the two languages of interest.	O	O	Review	394
While the results are interesting I find very few original ideas in this paper.	O	O	Review	394
Please find my comments/questions/suggestions below:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) The authors mention that there are 3 important aspects in which their model differs from a standard NMT architecture.	B-Review	B-1	Review	394
All the 3 differences have been adapted from existing works.	I-Review	I-1	Review	394
The authors clearly acknowledge and cite the sources.	I-Review	I-1	Review	394
Even sharing the encoder using cross lingual embeddings has been explored in the context of multilingual NER (please see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00198)."	O	O	Review	394
target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00198).</a> Because of this I find the paper to be a bit lacking on the novelty quotient.	O	O	Review	394
Even backtranslation has been used successfully in the past (as acknowledged by the authors).	B-Review	B-1	Review	394
Unsupervised MT in itself is not a new idea (again clearly acknowledged by the authors).	I-Review	I-1	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) I am not very convinced about the idea of denoising.	B-Review	B-2	Review	394
Specifically, I am not sure if it will work for arbitrary language pairs.	I-Review	I-2	Review	394
In fact, I think there is a contradiction even in the way the authors write this.	I-Review	I-2	Review	394
On one hand, they want to "learn the internal structure of the languages involved" and on the other hand they deliberately corrupt this structure by adding noise.	I-Review	I-2	Review	394
This seems very counter-intuitive and in fact the results in Table 1 suggest that it leads to a drop in performance.	I-Review	I-2	Review	394
I am not very sure that the analogy with autoencoders holds in this case.	I-Review	I-2	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) Following up on the above question, the authors mention that "We emphasize, however, that it is not possible to use backtranslation alone without denoising".	B-Review	B-3	Review	394
Again, if denoising itself leads to a drop in the performance as compared to the nearest neighbor baseline then why use backtranslation in conjunction with denoising and not in conjunction with the baseline itself.	I-Review	I-3	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4) This point is more of a clarification and perhaps due to my lack of understanding.	I-Review	I-3	Review	394
Backtranslation to generate a pseudo corpus makes sense only after the model has achieved a certain (good) performance.	I-Review	I-3	Review	394
Can you please provide details of how long did you train the model (with denoising?)	I-Review	I-3	Review	394
before producing the backtranslations ?	I-Review	I-3	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]5) The authors mention that 100K parallel sentences may be insufficient for training a NMT system.	B-Review	B-4	Review	394
However, this size may be decent enough for  a PBSMT system.	I-Review	I-4	Review	394
It would be interesting to see the performance of a PBSMT system trained on 100K parallel sentences.	I-Review	I-4	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]6) How did you arrive at the beam size of 12 ?	B-Review	B-5	Review	394
Was this a hyperparameter?	I-Review	I-5	Review	394
Just curious.	I-Review	I-5	Review	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]7) The comparable NMT set up is not very clear.	B-Review	B-6	Review	394
Can you please explain it in detail ?	I-Review	I-6	Review	394
In the same paragraph, what exactly do you mean by "the supervised system in this paper is relatively small?"	I-Review	I-6	Review	394
Thanks for the insightful comments.	O	O	Reply	394
Please find the answers to the specific points below, which were also addressed in the revised version of the paper:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) We are aware that the basic building blocks of our work come from previous work and, as you note, we try to properly acknowledge that in the paper.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	394
However, we do not see this as a weakness, but rather an inherent characteristic of science as a collaborative effort.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	394
Our contribution lies in combining these basic building blocks in a novel way to build the first fully unsupervised NMT system.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	394
We believe that this is an important contribution on its own: NMT is a highly relevant field where the predominant approach has been supervised and, for the first time, we show that an unsupervised approach is also viable.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	394
As such, we think that our work explores a highly original idea and opens a new and exciting research direction.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) This is a very interesting observation, but we think that, paradoxically, corrupting the structure of the language is necessary for the system to learn such structure.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	394
Note that, without denoising, this training step would be reduced to a trivial copying task that admits degenerated solutions.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
The intuition is that one can easily copy a sentence in any language even if they know nothing about that language.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
In contrast, adding noise to the input makes the task of reconstructing the input non-trivial, and forces the system to learn about the structure of that language to be able to solve it.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
The intuition in this case is that, if we are given a scrambled sentence in some language, it is not possible for us to recover the original sentence unless we have some knowledge of the language in question.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
In other words, the idea of denoising is to corrupt the structure of the input, so the system needs to learn the correct structure in order to recover the original uncorrupted input (this is possible because the system does see the correct structure in the output during training).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
Note that this has also been found to help extract good representations from natural language sentences by other authors (Hill et al 2016).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
Regarding arbitrary language pairs, we think that this idea is particularly relevant for distant pairs: corrupting the word order of the input makes the shared encoder rely less in this word order, which is necessary for distant language pairs with more divergences in this regard.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3/4) There seems to be some confusion here on how our training procedure works in relation to backtranslation.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	394
Note that each training iteration performs one mini-batch of denoising and one mini-batch of backtranslation in each direction, and the bactranslation step at iteration i uses the model from iteration (i-1).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	394
This way, denoising and backtranslation keep constantly improving the model, and backtranslation itself uses the most recent model at each time.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	394
This is in contrast with traditional backtranslation, where a fixed model is used to backtranslate the entire corpus at one time.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	394
In relation to point 3, while denoising alone is certainly weaker than the nearest neighbor baseline, the combination of denoising and backtransation eventually leads to a stronger model, which backtranslation itself takes advantage of in the following iterations as just described.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]5) The purpose of this experiment was to show that the proposed system can also benefit from small parallel corpora, making it suitable not only for the unsupervised scenario, but also for the semi-supervised scenario.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	394
As such, our point was not to improve the state of the art under these conditions, but rather to show that our work has potential interest beyond the strictly unsupervised scenario.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]6) A beam size of 12 is very common in previous work (Sutskever et al 2014; Sennrich et al 2016a;b; He et al 2016), so we also adopted it for our experiments without any further exploration.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]7) The comparable NMT system uses the exact same architecture and hyperparameters as the unsupervised system (number of layers, hidden units, attention model etc.).	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	394
Furthermore, it incorporates the non-standard variations in Section 3.1 (dual structure using a shared encoder with fixed embeddings).	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	394
The only difference is that, instead of training it on monolingual corpora using denoising and backtranslation, it is trained on parallel corpora just as standard NMT.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	394
[line_break_token][line_break_token]When we say that "the supervised system in this paper is relatively small", we mean that the size of the model (number of layers, training time etc.)	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	394
is small compared to the state of the art, which explains in part why its results are also weaker.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	394
However, note that this also applies to the unsupervised system, which uses the exact same settings.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	394
We therefore believe that there is a considerable margin to improve our results by using a larger model	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	394

[Overview][line_break_token][line_break_token]In this paper, the authors proposed a new clustering method called deep amortized clustering (DAC).	O	O	Review	20399
Inspired by Lee et al 2019, the authors exploited a transformer to gather the contextual information across different dataset points and then predict the cluster label for each data point.	O	O	Review	20399
The main difference from Lee et al is that the proposed DAC sequentially estimate the cluster labels for the data points and thus more flexible to estimate the number of clusters in the whole dataset.	O	O	Review	20399
Based on the proposed DAC method, the authors evaluated the performance on both unsupervised clustering and supervised clustering tasks.	O	O	Review	20399
it turns out the proposed method has achieved better or comparable performance to previous work on various datasets while hold less computational cost.	O	O	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Pros][line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	20399
In this paper, the authors extended the clustering method in Lee et al to a new method called Deep Amortized Clustering (DAC) for data clustering.	O	O	Review	20399
In this new method, the number of clusters can be unknown at the beginning and the model itself will sequentially cluster the data points into different groups until are data points have been assigned to some clusters.	O	O	Review	20399
This is an interesting method in that it does not need to specify the number of clusters at the beginning, and thus become more flexible.	O	O	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	20399
To achieve the DAC, the authors proposed two losses, one is Minimum Loss Filtering (MLF) and one is Anchor Filtering to cope with either multi-gaussian-distributed data points or even harder datasets.	O	O	Review	20399
Meanwhile, the authors also proposed to estimate the density P(x; \theta) in the case that the distribution is not knowing in prior.	O	O	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	O	O	Review	20399
The authors evaluated the proposed method on both synthetic dataset and realistic dataset.	O	O	Review	20399
On the synthetic dataset, the proposed method is compared with VBDPM and ACT-ST, two methods that can cope with dataset with unknown number of clusters.	O	O	Review	20399
On the realistic datasets, the authors evaluated on the EMNIST which is of non-MoG distribution.	O	O	Review	20399
Besides, the authors further evaluated the method on MiniImageNet features and Omniglot dataset, and showcased comparable performance to previous methods but much shorter running  time.	O	O	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Cons][line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	20399
Overall, the paper is poorly written and organized.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20399
First, the notations in the method section are hard to follow.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20399
There are a number of notations which are all capital characters, either representing a function or a method.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20399
Second, the whole training process and inference process of the proposed method is not clear to me.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20399
How the model is trained on the training set, what are the learnable parameters in the proposed model and what are the settings for the hyper-parameters, etc.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20399
Third, it is hard to get the takeaway messages from the experiment sections.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20399
The experimental settings for each subsection are not very clearly explained, and the analysis on the experimental results are also vague.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	20399
In the method, the authors proposed Minimum Loss Filtering (MLF) for clustering with the loss function in Eq(5).	B-Review	B-2	Review	20399
During training, the authors use some training data with ground-truth labels to optimize the loss function.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20399
However, it is not clear which parameters will be learned in the optimization.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20399
Also, after the training, what the exact inference procedure should be is also not clear to me.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20399
Overall, it is really hard to me to follow this section on the filtering process.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20399
The authors should definitely describe the process more clearly.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	O	O	Review	20399
The experimental results shown in the paper are hard to interpret.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20399
First, the setting for each experiment is not clear to me.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20399
In Figure 3, it is hard to understand the figures clearly.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20399
In table 2 and table 3, some of the clustering methods are deterministic, such as K-means, Spectral clustering, DEC.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20399
However, some other clustering methods are learning to clustering methods, such as KCL and MCL.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20399
Putting all of the numbers in the same table is confusing and make it hard to compare.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20399
I would suggest the authors make a clear distinction between different methods: 1) deep clustering methods which directly cluster on top of the test set; 2) learning to clustering method which learn some parameters on training set and then generalize to test set; 3) amortized clustering, which also learn some parameters on training and then test on the test set with just one forward pass.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20399
Splitting the testing results into three group will be helpful to the readers to understand the paper and the proposed method.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4.	O	O	Review	20399
Another missed part in the model is the ablation study.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20399
How sensitive the model is to different training set, e.g., different training dataset size, different number of training clusters, and different hyper-parameters, etc.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20399
Without these information, it is hard to know how well robust the proposed DAC method can generalize.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20399
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]5.	O	O	Review	20399
Finally, the proposed method was built upon Lee at al 2019, to extend the previous method to a sequential clustering problem.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20399
I think a title "deep amortized clustering" is a bit misleading and exaggerated on the proposed method.	I-Review	I-5	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Summary][line_break_token][line_break_token]In this paper, the authors proposed a new method called Deep Amortized Clustering (DAC) for amortized clustering.	O	O	Review	20399

This is a meaningful method in that it can be applied to those data without explicit number of clusters.	O	O	Review	20399
However, the presentation of the method and experiments make it hard to follow, and thus hard to capture the contributions of the proposed method, and also its capacity.	B-Review	B-6	Review	20399

Summary:[line_break_token]The paper presents an amortized clustering method, called DAC, which is a neural architecture that allows efficient data clustering using a few forward passes.	O	O	Review	20399
The proposed method is essentially based on the idea behind set-input neural networks [1], which consists of modeling the interaction between instances within a given dataset.	O	O	Review	20399
Compared with the previous work [1], the main difference is that DAC does not need to specify the number of clusters, as in the case of Bayesian nonparametrics, making it more flexible for clustering complex datasets.	O	O	Review	20399
It is empirically shown that DAC can efficiently and accurately cluster new datasets coming from the same distribution for both synthetic and image data.	O	O	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Strengths:[line_break_token]Overall, I think the paper is well written and the relationship to previous works is well described.	O	O	Review	20399
The empirical results seem promising, especially in terms of computational efficiency.	O	O	Review	20399
The authors conduct some experiments on relatively large datasets, such as miniImageNet and tiereImageNet, which is indeed crucial for the practical applications of the proposed model.	O	O	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weaknesses:[line_break_token]- I think this is a good paper, but my major concern is the limited theoretical contribution, given the fact that this work is mainly based on set-input neural networks introduced in Ref. [	B-Review	B-1	Review	20399
1]. I would like the authors to clarify a bit more the novelty of the paper.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20399
[line_break_token]- The authors claim that DAC can process data points in parallel while Ref. [	B-Review	B-2	Review	20399
2] uses a sequential sampling procedure.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20399
However, there does not seem to be sufficient details on how to parallelize the proposed algorithm.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20399
[line_break_token]- As shown in Figs.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20399
1 and 4, it seems that some clusters are split into two or three fragments.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20399
I think this simply means the failure of the proposed method on synthetic data.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20399
[line_break_token]- As also mentioned in the discussion on page 8, it would be important to consider uncertainties in cluster assignments, as already done in Ref. [	B-Review	B-4	Review	20399
2]. I would recommend the authors to provide some insight on how to take the cluster assignment uncertainty into account within current model.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token]At the moment, I recommend a weak reject as the technical contribution of the paper seems rather limited, but I could be open to increasing my score if my concerns are addressed.	O	O	Review	20399

Novelty] We argue that our paper is not a mere application of the Set Transformer proposed in Lee et al 2019.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20399
The core contribution of this paper is a framework for training a flexible and robust amortized clustering model.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20399
The Set Transformer is simply the architectural backbone we used to implement our framework, much like how one might use a standard ResNet backbone to verify a new idea in computer vision.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20399
We summarize our contribution as follows:[line_break_token]1.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20399
A new learning framework that decomposes the clustering problem into a sequence of filtering problems along with a learning objective to achieve this.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20399
This is completely different from the amortized clustering objective used in Lee et al 2019, where they try to maximize the overall likelihood of datasets.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20399

In contrast, the clustering model of (Lee et al 2019) is restricted to a mixture of Gaussians model and thus cannot be used on e.g. miniImagenet.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Parallel processing] The parallelization of our model is fairly simple, and our provided code is implemented in this way.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20399
Assume we are given D datasets, each with N images of size (H, W, C).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20399
The input to our DAC model would be a 5-dimensional tensor with shape [D, N, H, W, C]. After each step of filtering, we simply apply the appropriate filtering mask to each of the D datasets and feed the resulting 5-dimensional tensor through the network again for the next step.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20399
This whole process is easily parallelized on modern deep learning libraries (we used PyTorch).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20399
In contrast, the neural clustering process requires sequential sampling that iterates over datapoints, which cannot be parallelized.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20399
The number of forward passes required for each dataset is O(N) for the Neural Clustering Process (NCP) and O(K) for DAC.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20399
This allowed us to consider tasks with up to N=3000 2D points or N=100 images, while such large problems would be very time-consuming for NCP.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Fragmented clusters] While we agree that DAC did not find the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù clustering on those examples, we think it is rather harsh to say the algorithm failed because of the fragmented cluster.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20399
Such fragmented clusters are commonly found in MoG-based clustering methods, due to the diagonal covariance assumption and the structure of the loss.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20399
We further point out that the DAC models used to generate Figs 1, 4 were trained on datasets with at most 4 clusters and 1000 data points, and were tested on a dataset with far more clusters and data points.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20399
Figs 1, 4 demonstrate that DAC is capable of generalizing to such drastically different datasets, which we attribute to our iterative filtering procedure.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20399
Results in Table 1 show that DAC was significantly better than previous methods in this particular task.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Uncertainty in cluster assignments] A simple way to accomplish this in DAC, which we considered in early experiments, is to use the assignment probability (instead of hard assignment masks) as input to the next filtering step.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	20399
We excluded this from the manuscript as it did not increase clustering accuracy.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20399
As stated on page 8, we believe such uncertainty-aware amortized clustering is an important and interesting research topic, and we plan to investigate this problem in more detail in future work.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20399

This paper proposed a deep amortized clustering framework which learns to cluster data efficiently  based on the combination of set transformer and amortized clustering.	O	O	Review	20399
   The main motivation is to learn clustering rules from labeled data sets and generalize to new data sets, so as to avoid manually defining clustering criterion.	O	O	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Not an expert in this domain, I feel that the paper is not easy to read and many intuitions readers might be interested in are not explained very well.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20399
For example, the authors mentioned that the method proceeds sequentially, and each step identifies one cluster (the easiest cluster).	I-Review	I-1	Review	20399
However, in practical situations clusters might be meaningful only when considered in a global context, and / or under a certain scale, and more discussions are needed on how the proposed method achieves these goals.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20399
 Also, how the set transformer extracts  information useful for clustering is very unclear and needs more elaborations.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors used anchor points in harder problems, where the anchor points are uniformly sampled from the input data.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20399
One concern is that random sampling may lead to fluctuations in the learning process as well as very close anchor points which can be harmful for clustering.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The visualization of identified clusters seems a bit misleading.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20399
Some very compact clusters seem to be split into halfs (or with fragments of different colors) and does this indicate failed clustering on these simple data sets?	I-Review	I-3	Review	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally, whether useful rules can be learned for clustering from labeled data is still quite open and authors may want to give some convincing examples of such rules'' for which existing clustering criterion will fail but with learned rules it can be resolved.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20399
It looks to be that the result has to do with the clustering structures of the labeled data and how can one be sure that the training data have a similar clustering structure with the to-be-clustered-data?	I-Review	I-4	Review	20399
Without answering this basic concerns, the proposed method may be hard to be accepted.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20399
Clusters only meaningful in global context] Please note that our network takes the entire set as an input for each step of filtering.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20399
Our system filters out a single cluster at a time, taking into account the topology of the whole dataset.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20399
Although we cannot describe what is going on under the hood of DAC (interpreting any neural network is a very challenging problem), our intuition is that its self-attention layers learn to identify clusters by comparing nearby data points while also taking global context into account.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20399
Rather than interpreting how our model extracts cluster information, we demonstrated through experiments that its learned strategy can successfully cluster previously unseen datasets in many different settings.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20399
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Anchor points] We agree with your point that bad anchor points may harm clustering, in the case of synthetic 2D data.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20399
Empirically, we found that the anchor point method is very effective in high-dimensional image datasets; in the paper, we apply anchored filtering only to image data.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20399
Our intuition for this is that since the anchor method selects a cluster for the model, it accelerates training in the early stages where the model must learn low-level features from scratch.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20399
Additionally, anchoring forces the network to not be biased towards always identifying a specific cluster (e.g. leftmost, darkest‚Ä¶).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20399

If we naively apply MoG in this case, the algorithm would completely fail because of the wrong assumption of the cluster shapes.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20399
On the other hand, DAC makes no assumption on the shapes of the clusters.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20399
DAC succeeded in learning the densities of clusters along with a strategy for assigning data points to those clusters, based on only the partition structures of the training datasets.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20399
I think this demonstrates that our argument is valid.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20399
[line_break_token]As we clearly stated, our algorithm assumes that the datasets to be clustered are similar to the datasets seen during training.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20399
The model will fail If this assumption does not hold.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20399
However, please note that any machine learning algorithm based on empirical risk minimization would fail in this case.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20399

Authors propose to overcome the sparse reward problem using an exploration strategy that incentivizes the agent to visit different parts of the game screen.	O	O	Review	1626
This is done by building Q-maps, a 3D tensor that measures the value of the agent's current state (defined as the position of the agent) and action in reaching other (x, y) locations in the map.	O	O	Review	1626
Each 2D slice of the Q-map measures the value at different (x, y) locations for one action.	O	O	Review	1626
Such 2D slices (i.e. channels) are stacked together to form the Q-map.	O	O	Review	1626
Taking the max across the channels, thus, provides the Q-value for the optimal action.	O	O	Review	1626

The Q-map based exploration is used as a replacement for \epsilon-greedy exploration.	O	O	Review	1626
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The Q-map is used for exploration in the following way:[line_break_token](a) Chose a random action with probability \epsilon_r.	O	O	Review	1626
[line_break_token](b) If neither a random action nor a "goal" is chosen, a new goal is chosen with probability \epislon_g.	O	O	Review	1626
The goal is a (x, y) location, chosen so that is not too hard or too easy to reach it (i.e. Q-map values are neither too high or low; intuitively [1 - Q-map(x, y, a)] (for normalized/clipped Q) is a measure of distance of the goal).	O	O	Review	1626

I am still confused by figure 3 -- when are random goals chosen?	I-Review	I-1	Review	1626
Do random goals correspond to (b) above?	I-Review	I-1	Review	1626
Also, when the Horde architecture, GVF and UVF are mentioned, the references are missing -- I would love for the authors to include the corresponding  references.	I-Review	I-1	Review	1626
 [line_break_token][line_break_token](ii) The idea of reaching as many states as possible has been explored in count based visitation (Bellemare et al, Tang et al) ‚Äî but no comparisons have been made to any previous work.	B-Review	B-2	Review	1626

[line_break_token][line_break_token](iii) The authors propose biased and random goal sampling ‚Äî I would love to see how much improvement does biased goal sampling offer over random goal sampling.	B-Review	B-3	Review	1626

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, I like the idea of incentivizing exploration without changing the reward function as is done in multiple prior works.	O	O	Review	1626

The main idea in the paper is to use on-screen locations as goals for an RL agent.	O	O	Review	1626
Using a de-convolutional network to parameterize the Q-function allows all goals to be updated at once and correlations between nearby or similar goal locations could be modelled.	O	O	Review	1626

Furthermore, the learned values are not used in any practical manner.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1626
Q-map on the other hand, is trained to minimize the number of steps towards all goal coordinates which can be used for a variety of applications, such as exploration as shown in the paper, goal-oriented control (e.g. if the task is to reach some coordinates), or hierarchical RL.

This paper addresses one of the major shortcomings of generative adversarial networks - their lack of mechanism for evaluating held-out data.	O	O	Review	237
While other work such as BiGANs/ALI address this by learning a separate inference network, here the authors propose to change the GAN objective function such that the optimal discriminator is also an energy function, rather than becoming uninformative at the optimal solution.	O	O	Review	237
Training this new objective requires gradients of the entropy of the generated data, which are difficult to approximate, and the authors propose two methods to do so, one based on nearest neighbors and one based on a variational lower bound.	O	O	Review	237
The results presented show that on toy data the learned discriminator/energy function closely approximates the log probability of the data, and on more complex data the discriminator give a good measure of quality for held out data.	O	O	Review	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I would say the largest shortcomings of the paper are practical issues around the scalability of the nearest neighbors approximation and accuracy of the variational approximation, which the authors acknowledge.	B-Review	B-3	Review	237
Also, since entropy estimation and density estimation are such closely linked problems, I wonder if any practical method for EGANs will end up being equivalent to some form of approximate density estimation, exactly the problem GANs were designed to circumvent.	I-Review	I-3	Review	237
Nonetheless, the elegant mathematical exposition alone makes the paper a worthwhile contribution to the literature.	I-Review	I-3	Review	237

[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree that a scalable entropy estimation method is the core to the proposed formulation.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	237
Also, it is true the entropy estimation problem is closely related to density estimation, especially for the exponential families.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	237
However, for the proposed formulation, what we really need is the estimation of entropy ‚Äúgradient‚Äù, which can be practically easier.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	237
As shown by Equation (9) of the updated paper, it amounts to estimating the score function: d log p_gen(x) / d x. In this work, the nearest neighbors approximation is an example of thinking in this direction.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Another direction of thinking is that since we only need a proper gradient, is it possible to build another network to provide the gradient estimation.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	237
Actually, this extra network can provide the gradient estimation by backward propagation, or even by forward propagation [1]. For now, the variational inference is an example of using the backward propagation to provide a gradient estimation.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	237
More interestingly, as GANs were initially designed to bypass an explicit density estimation, it is conceptually tempting to think about using an adversarial process to get an implicit entropy estimation.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We believe all these ideas are worth exploring as future work.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In addition to these technical possibilities, another ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù here is that in theory, we can have infinite samples from the generator to estimate the entropy (gradient), which is usually impossible for normal density estimation based on empirical data.

The authors present a method for changing the objective of generative adversarial networks such that the discriminator accurately recovers density information about the underlying data distribution.	O	O	Review	237
In the course of deriving the changed objective they prove that stability of the discriminator is not guaranteed in the standard GAN setup but can be recovered via an additional entropy regularization term.	O	O	Review	237

[line_break_token]- Generally speaking, the core difficulty of evaluating our discriminator lies in that an energy function is measuring the relative ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù among samples on the data manifold, rather than distinguishing whether samples are on the data manifold or not (fake vs. real).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	237
To evaluate the relative goodness, it is most natural to think about ranking.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	237
Unfortunately, we do not have the ground truth ranking for direct evaluation.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	237

The submission explores several alternatives to provide the generator function in generative adversarial training with additional gradient information.	O	O	Review	237
The exposition starts by describing a general formulation about how this additional gradient information (termed K(p_gen) could be added to the generative adversarial training objective function (Equation 1).	O	O	Review	237
Next, the authors prove that the shape of the optimal discriminator does indeed depend on the added gradient information (Proposition 3.1), which is unsurprising.	O	O	Review	237
Finally, the authors propose three particular alternatives to construct K(p_gen): the negative entropy of the generator distribution, the L2 norm of the generator distribution, and a constant function (which resembles the EBGAN objective of Zhao et al, 2016).	O	O	Review	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The exposition moves then to an experimental evaluation of the method, which sets K(p_gen) to be the approximate entropy of the generator distribution.	O	O	Review	237
At this point, my intuition is that the objective function under study is the vanilla GAN objective, plus a regularization term that encourages diversity (high entropy) in the generator distribution.	O	O	Review	237
The hope of the authors is that this regularization will transform the discriminator into an estimate of the energy landscape of the data distribution.	O	O	Review	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experimental evaluation proceeds by 1) showing the contour plots of the obtained generator distribution for a 2D problem, 2) studying the generation diversity in MNIST digits, and 3) showing some samples for CIFAR-10 and CelebA. The 2D problem results are convincing, since one can clearly observe that the discriminator scores translate into unnormalized values of the density function.	O	O	Review	237
The MNIST results offer good intuition also: the more prototypical digits are assigned larger scores (unnormalized densities) by the discriminator, and the less prototypical digits are assigned smaller scores.	O	O	Review	237
The sample experiments from Section 5.3 are less convincing, since no samples from baseline models are provided for comparison.	B-Review	B-1	Review	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To this end, I would recommend the authors to clarify three aspects.	O	O	Review	237
First, we have seen that entropy regularization leads to a discriminator that estimates the energy landscape of the data distribution.	B-Review	B-2	Review	237
But, how does this regularization reshape the generator function?	I-Review	I-2	Review	237
It would be nice to see the mean MNIST digit according to the generator, and some other statistics if possible.	I-Review	I-2	Review	237
Second, how do the samples produced by the proposed methods compare (visually speaking) to the state-of-the art?	B-Review	B-3	Review	237
Third, what are the *shortcomings* of this method versus vanilla GAN?	B-Review	B-4	Review	237
Too much computational overhead?	I-Review	I-4	Review	237
What are the qualitative and quantitative differences between the two entropy estimators proposed in the manuscript?	I-Review	I-4	Review	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, a clearly written paper.	O	O	Review	237
I vote for acceptance.	O	O	Review	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As an open question to the authors: What breakthroughs should we pursue to derive a GAN objective where the discriminator is an estimate of the data density function, after training?	B-Review	B-5	Review	237

[line_break_token][line_break_token][Response]:[line_break_token]- The primary purpose of Section 5.3 is to show that adding the calibrating term K(p_gen) does not degrade sample quality compared to existing convolutional GAN variants (see DCGAN <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v2.pdf)."

EBGAN also uses additional techniques to boost sample quality, including margin-based cost and a pulling-away term.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	237

[line_break_token][line_break_token][Response]:[line_break_token]In theory, the optimal generator distribution p_gen(x) should match the true data distribution p_data(x) as stated by Proposition 3.1.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	237
To verify that empirically, we can definitely provide more samples from the trained generator as well as the mean generator sample later in the appendix.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	237

[line_break_token][line_break_token][Response][line_break_token]As mentioned above, we believe the sample quality of the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art results, which are arguably either from GAN variants or from Pixel RNN and Pixel CNN (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06759.pdf)."

[line_break_token][line_break_token]====================================================================================[line_break_token][Comment 3]: Third, what are the *shortcomings* of this method versus vanilla GAN?	O	O	Reply	237
Too much computational overhead?	O	O	Reply	237
What are the qualitative and quantitative differences between the two entropy estimators proposed in the manuscript?	O	O	Reply	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Response]:[line_break_token]We think this is a good question worth some systematic future work.	O	O	Reply	237
For now, based on our empirical observations and some properties of the training objective, we make the following comments:[line_break_token]- Computational overhead is not a big issue.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	237
For the KNN based approach, the heaviest computation is to compute the cross-term in the Euclidean distance, which requires a matrix-matrix multiplication of shape [BxD] x [DxB], where B is the mini-batch size and D is the feature size.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	237
With a reasonable mini-batch size (we used 200), the computation overhead is equal to that of a fully-connected layer with a weight matrix of shape [DxB], which is quite common.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	237
As for the VI based approach, the inference network is essentially a replica of the discriminator.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	237
Thus, it requires strictly less than double the original computation.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	237
[line_break_token]- A potential issue of the proposed formulation is the quality of the approximate entropy gradient.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	237
On the one hand, when the approximate entropy gradient (1) is not accurate, and (2) has a large magnitude, it can significantly slow down the training.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	237
Basically, the inaccurate and large-magnitude entropy gradient will act like some chaotic noise, which dominates the discriminator gradient with its large magnitude, pushes the generator to wander around purposelessly, and thus makes the training very slow.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	237
On the other hand, when the estimated entropy gradient is accurate, it can actually speed up the training by encouraging the generator to ‚Äúexplore‚Äù regions where p_gen(x) is currently low.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	237
Thus, how to obtain a good entropy gradient estimate is an important topic under our formulation.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]====================================================================================[line_break_token][Open question]: What breakthroughs should we pursue to derive a GAN objective where the discriminator is an estimate of the data density function, after training?	O	O	Reply	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Response]:[line_break_token]Generally speaking, in order to obtain a normalized density estimation, either the training procedure and the parameterization automatically guarantee a normalized result, or some proper post-normalization will be needed.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	237
Actually, our current proposed formulation may potentially fall into the second case (see below).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For the first case, the question effectively becomes whether one can derive a GAN-type formulation where the discriminator is self-normalized at the optimum.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
Intuitively, this self-normalization requirement sounds like posing an additional regularization on the discriminator.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
However, it‚Äôs difficult to specify the form of the regularization, and it can be a set constraint on the allowed parameterization of the discriminator or some additional term in the training objective.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
Either way, the high-level idea is to absorb the explicit normalization step into either the parameterization or the training process.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As for the second case (post normalization), our current proposed formulation offers some directions of exploration, though there are still many challenges as we will discuss in the following.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	237
Because we have provided a case in Equation (6) where the discriminator recovers the negative density function plus some underdetermined terms, we can consider how to eliminate the ambiguity caused by the extra underdetermined terms and thus obtain an estimate of the (negative) data density.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	237
For this, note that the true difficulty is in the weak support discriminator term, without which we can calculate the global bias using the normalization condition sum_x p(x) = 1.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
Actually, there are two situations where is zero and can be dropped.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
The first one is when the data distribution has infinite support.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
However, since high-dimensional data usually resides on a low-dimensional manifold, this condition may not hold.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
The second situation is that we have a clear idea about the boundary of the data support and thus we can only consider the region inside the data support.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
But in general, without prior knowledge, identifying the boundary of data support from empirical data is an ill-posed problem.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	237
One may also consider whether we can properly renormalize the obtained energy function into the data density.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	237
To do the normalization properly, we will actually encounter the same data support problem as mentioned above.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
In addition to that, another challenge is that the approximate entropy gradient may have an imprecise scale.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
For example, in Equation (10), we normalize the gradient into unit norm and use the hyper-parameter to control the overall scale.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
Effectively, the imprecise scale is equivalent to adding a multiplicative weight to the calibrating term in Equation (1), i.e. the objective becomes max_{c} min_{p_gen} E_{p_gen} [c(x)] - E_{p_data} [c(x)] + weight * K(p_gen).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
Hence, the discriminator calibrated by negative entropy should converge to c(x) = - weight * log p_data(x) + lambda + mu(x).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
Basically, the weight plays the same role as the ‚Äútemperature‚Äù hyper-parameter in a Gibbs distribution.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
Although the temperature does not change the relative ranking of samples in terms of energy/density, it changes the absolute value of the density.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
When the temperature is smaller than 1, it will flatten the distribution.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
When the temperature is larger than 1, it will make the distribution spikier.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
So, the quality of the entropy gradient is again a core issue here.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally, since the question is quite open and has different interpretations, if we've misinterpreted the question, we'd be glad to answer further clarifying questions	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	237

In this paper, the authors consider solving three ML security related challenges that would primarily arise[line_break_token]in the cloud based ML model.	O	O	Review	128
Namely, they consider the setting where a client wishes to obtain predictions[line_break_token]from an ML model hosted on a server, while being sure that the server is running the model they believe is being run[line_break_token]and without the server learning nothing about their input.	O	O	Review	128
Additionally, the server wishes for the user to learn [line_break_token]nothing about the model other than its output on the user's input.	O	O	Review	128
To solve this problem, the authors introduce a[line_break_token]new scheme for running ML algorithms in a trusted execution environment.	O	O	Review	128
The key idea is to oursource expensive[line_break_token]computation involved with forwarding images through a model to an untrusted GPU in a way that still allows for[line_break_token]the TEE to verify the integrity of the GPU's output.	O	O	Review	128
Because the authors' method is able to utilize GPU computing,[line_break_token]they achieve substantial speed-ups compared to methods that run the full neural network in trusted hardware.	O	O	Review	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, I found the paper to be very well written and easy to digest, and the basic idea to be simple.	O	O	Review	128
The [line_break_token]authors strike a nice balance between details left to the appendix and the high level overview explained in[line_break_token]the paper.	O	O	Review	128
At the same time, the authors' proposed solution seems to achieve reasonably practicable performance[line_break_token]and provides a simple high-throughput solution to some interesting ML security problems that seems readily[line_break_token]applicable in the ML-as-a-cloud-service use case.	O	O	Review	128
I only have a few comments and feedback.	O	O	Review	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I would recommend the authors use the full 10 pages available by moving key results from the appendix to the main[line_break_token]text.	B-Review	B-1	Review	128
At present, much of the experimental evaluation performed is done in the appendix (e.g., Figures 3 through [line_break_token]5).	I-Review	I-1	Review	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The notation PR_{s \overset{s}{\gets}\mathbb{S}^{n}}[...] is not defined anywhere as far as I can tell[line_break_token]before its first usage in Lemma 2.1.	B-Review	B-2	Review	128
Does this just denote the probability over a uniform random draw of[line_break_token]s from \mathbb{S}?	I-Review	I-2	Review	128
If so, I might recommend just dropping the subscript: A, B, and C being deterministic[line_break_token]makes the sample space unambiguous. "	I-Review	I-2	Review	128
negl(\lambda)" is also undefined.	I-Review	I-2	Review	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In section three you claim that Slalom could be extended to other architectures like residual networks.	B-Review	B-3	Review	128
[line_break_token]Can you give some intuition on how straightforward it would be to implement operations like concatenation[line_break_token](required for DenseNets)?	I-Review	I-3	Review	128
I would expect these operations could be implemented in the TEE rather than [line_break_token]on the coprocessor and then verified.	I-Review	I-3	Review	128
However, the basic picture on the left of Figure 1 may then change,[line_break_token]as the output of each layer may need to be verified before concatenation?	I-Review	I-3	Review	128
I think augmenting the right[line_break_token]of Figure 1 to account for these operations may be straightforward.	I-Review	I-3	Review	128
It would be interesting to see[line_break_token]throughput results on these networks, particularly because they are known to substantially outperform[line_break_token]VGG in terms of classification performance.	I-Review	I-3	Review	128
We thank the reviewer for the positive review and insightful comments.	O	O	Reply	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We followed the suggestion to make use of 10 pages of content (we originally found the ICLR Call for Papers to be somewhat unclear in this regard).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	128
We have moved parts of the Appendix into the main body, i.e., the SGX microbenchmarks as well as our discussion of challenges with extending Slalom to DNN training.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree that the notation PR_{s \overset{s}{\gets}\mathbb{S}^{n}}[...] is overly verbose and we have removed the redundant in our updated manuscript.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	128
We have also added a definition for a negligible function.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	128
[line_break_token]    [line_break_token]We followed the great suggestion to apply Slalom to more complex architectures.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	128
We have added experiments with ResNet models which make use of residual connections (handling concatenation layers would require similar changes to our framework).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	128
Extending Slalom's integrity checks (the left part in Figure 1) is quite trivial.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	128
The TEE simply applies Freivalds' algorithm to every linear operator and makes sure that it performs appropriate "book-keeping" of which layers' outputs correspond to which other layers' inputs.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	128
For privacy (the right part in Figure 1), things can get a bit more complicated as the TEE and GPU have to interact for each linear layer.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	128
For a residual layer, the TEE and GPU essentially run Slalom on both "paths" of the layer one after the other.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	128
The TEE saves intermediate results in its memory and then merges the results.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	128
The same would work for concatenation layers.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	128
Our results with ResNets are on par with those obtained with VGG16 and MobileNet.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	128
We tried different variants (18, 34, 50, 101 and 152 layers), and achieve 6.6-14.4x speedups for integrity and 4.4x-9.0x speedups with additional privacy	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	128

The authors propose a new method of securely evaluating neural networks.	O	O	Review	128
The approach builds upon existing Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), a combination of hardware and software that isolates sensitive computations from the untrusted software stack.	O	O	Review	128
The downside of TEE is that it is expensive and slow to run.	O	O	Review	128
This paper proposes outsourcing the linear evaluation portions of the DNN to an untrusted stack that's co-located with the TEE.	O	O	Review	128
To achieve privacy (i.e., the input isn't revealed to the untrusted evaluator), the approach adds a random number r to the input vector x, evaluates f(x+r) on the untrusted stack, then subtracts off f(r) from the output.	O	O	Review	128
This limits the approach to be applicable to only linear functions.	O	O	Review	128
To achieve integrity (verify the correctness of the output), the paper proposes testing with random input vectors (an application of Freivalds theorem, which bounds the error probability).	O	O	Review	128
The techniques for integrity and privacy works only on integer evaluations, hence the network weights and inputs need to be quantized.	O	O	Review	128
The paper tries to minimize degradation in accuracy by quantizing as finely as numerically allowable, achieving <0.5% drop in accuracy on two example DNNs.	O	O	Review	128
Overall, compared to full evaluation in a TEE, this approach is 10x faster on one DNN, and 40x to 64x faster on another network (depending on how the network is formulated).	O	O	Review	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Disclaimer: I am a complete outsider to the field of HW security and privacy.	O	O	Review	128
The paper is very readable, so I think I understand its overall gist.	O	O	Review	128
I found the approach to be novel and the results convincing, though I may be missing important context since I'm not familiar with the subject.	O	O	Review	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To me, the biggest missing piece is a discussion of the limitations of the approach.	B-Review	B-1	Review	128
How big of a network can be evaluated this way?	I-Review	I-1	Review	128
Is it sufficient for most common applications?	I-Review	I-1	Review	128
What are the bottlenecks to scaling this approach?	I-Review	I-1	Review	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]It's also not clear why integrity checks are required.	B-Review	B-2	Review	128
Is there a chance that the outsourcing could result in incorrect values? (	I-Review	I-2	Review	128
It's not obvious why it would.)	I-Review	I-2	Review	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Lastly, a question about quantization.	B-Review	B-3	Review	128
You try to quantize as finely as possible (to minimize quantization errors) by multiplying by the largest power of 2 possible without causing overflow.	I-Review	I-3	Review	128
Since quantization need to be applied to both input and network weights, does this mean that you must also bound the scale of the input?	I-Review	I-3	Review	128
Or do you assume that the inputs are pre-processed to be within a known scale?	I-Review	I-3	Review	128
Is this possible for intermediate outputs (i.e., after the input has been multiplied through a few layers of the DNN)?	I-Review	I-3	Review	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros:[line_break_token]- Simple yet effective approach to achieve the goals laid out in the problem statement[line_break_token]- Clearly written[line_break_token]- Thorough experiments and benchmarks[line_break_token]- Strong results[line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons:[line_break_token]- No discussion of limitations[line_break_token]- Minor questions regarding quantization and size limits[line_break_token][line_break_token]Disclaimer: reviewer is generally knowledgeable but not familiar with the subject area.

We thank the reviewer for the positive review and insightful comments.	O	O	Reply	128
It is encouraging to hear that our paper was easy to read for someone outside the field of HW security and privacy.	O	O	Reply	128
[line_break_token]    [line_break_token]We have made some changes to our manuscript to better illustrate the limitations and scalability of our approach.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	128
We have moved our micro-benchmarks from the Appendix to the main body, as suggested by the second reviewer.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
These benchmarks show that as the computation performed in a layer gets larger (e.g., more channels in a convolution), the savings incurred by Slalom increase!	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
[line_break_token]In principle, Slalom scales linearly with the number of layers added to a model, so long as all the pre-computed values do not exceed SGX's memory limits.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
To illustrate, we have experimented with the family of ResNet architectures, that range from 18 to 152 layers (and 44MB to 230MB of weights).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
For five different models (18, 34, 50, 101 and 152 layers), Slalom provides large savings in throughput (4.4x-14.4x) and the savings tend to be larger for larger networks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
We have added these results to our manuscript and we believe they illustrate Slalom's applicability and scalability to large models.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
In particular, the 152-layer ResNet model is among the deepest and most accurate models trained on ImageNet to date.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
[line_break_token]Lastly, we have also moved a section from the Appendix to the main body wherein we discuss some limitations and challenges with extending Slalom to DNN training.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
The main issues here are with weights changing during training which hinders quantization, pre-computation of Freivalds' checks, as well as pre-computed blinding factors for privacy.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
[line_break_token]    [line_break_token]Regarding the usefulness of integrity checks, these are also meant as a security guarantee.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	128
The threat model we consider here is that the server might *intentionally* compute incorrect values and send these back to the client.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	128
The SafetyNets paper by Ghodsi et al contains a good discussion of reasons why a client may want integrity guarantees from the server.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	128
One example is a "model-downgrade attack", where the server runs a cheaper (i.e., smaller) model than advertised, to minimize costs.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	128
More generally, it is commonly agreed upon in the cryptographic community that privacy without integrity is an insufficient guarantee (e.g., by tampering with a client's results and observing the side effects, a server might later learn something about the client's data).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For quantization, we simply assume that inputs are standard RGB images in the range [0, 255]. We then choose the quantization scales for inputs and weights so that none of the intermediate values in the network ever grow beyond p=2^23.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	128

For the sake of protecting privacy, this is done by establishing an additive secret share such that evaluation on one part of the share is performed offline and the computation on the other part of the share is performed on the untrusted engine.	O	O	Review	128
To verify the correctness of the computation on the untrusted server, a randomized algorithm is used to sample the correctness of the results.	O	O	Review	128
Using these techniques, the authors demonstrate an order of magnitude speedup compared to running only on the trusted engine and 3-4 orders of magnitude speedup compared to software-based solutions.	O	O	Review	128
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall this is a strong paper which presents good ideas that have influence in ML and beyond.	O	O	Review	128
I appreciate the fact that the authors are planning to make their code publicly available which makes it more reproducible.	O	O	Review	128
Below are a few comments/questions/suggestions [line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	128
[tab_token]This papers, and other papers too, propose mechanisms to protect the privacy of the data while outsourcing the computation on a prediction task.	B-Review	B-1	Review	128
However, an alternative approach would be to bring the computation to the data, which means performing the prediction on the client side.	I-Review	I-1	Review	128
In what sense is it better to outsource the computation?	I-Review	I-1	Review	128
Note that outsourcing the computation requires both complexity on the server side and additional computation on the client side (encryption & decryption).	O	O	Review	128
[line_break_token]2.	B-Review	B-3	Review	128
[tab_token]You present the limitations of the trust model of SGX only in the appendix while in the paper you compare to other techniques such as Gazzelle which have a different trust model and assumption.	B-Review	B-2	Review	128
It makes sense to, at least, hint the reader on these differences.	I-Review	I-2	Review	128

[line_break_token]4.	B-Review	B-4	Review	128
[tab_token]In Section 4.3: in one of the VGG experiment you computed only the convolution layers which, as you say, are commonly used to generate features.	I-Review	I-4	Review	128
In this case, however, doesn‚Äôt it make more sense that the feature generation will take place on the client side while only the upper layers (dense layers) will be outsourced?	I-Review	I-4	Review	128
[line_break_token]5.	O	O	Review	128
[tab_token]In section 4.3 ‚ÄúPrivate Inference‚Äù : do you include in the time reported also the offline preprocessing time?	B-Review	B-5	Review	128
As far as I understand this should take the same amount of time as computing on the TEE.	I-Review	I-5	Review	128

We thank the reviewer for the extremely positive review of our paper.	O	O	Reply	128

[line_break_token][line_break_token]To answer your insightful questions:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Reply	128
This is a great question, and such a system has recently been suggested in [1] (see below), which we now reference in our writeup.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	128
Probably the main differentiator is that in such a system, every single user requires trusted hardware (e.g., a recent Intel CPU), whereas in the cloud-outsourcing scheme which we and others have considered, only the server requires specialized hardware.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
[line_break_token]Using Slalom's techniques in a client-side execution might work, but the downside is that our algorithm assumes that the untrusted host has knowledge of the computed model.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
[line_break_token]One client-side application where Slalom might come in useful is for guaranteeing integrity in Federated Learning.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128
Here, each client evaluates a model on their own data, and the server may need some guarantees that those computations were performed correctly.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	128

Our evaluation primarily focuses on throughput.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	128
Low latency is also desirable of course, but this might require using a different untrusted processor as GPUs tend to be outperformed by CPUs when operating on single-element batches.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	128
In our experiments, we evaluate batches of images (around 16 images) on the GPU, and then verify a single image at a time in the TEE.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	128
By replacing the GPU with a high-end CPU, we could thus also achieve low latency using Slalom.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	128
[line_break_token]    [line_break_token]4.	O	O	Reply	128
VGG16 has the particularity that the feature extraction part (i.e., without the dense layers) makes up roughly 95% of the model's computation, but uses only maybe 5% of the weights (simply because VGG16's first dense layer is huge).	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	128
So outsourcing only the dense layers would unfortunately leave the client to do most of the work.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	128
[line_break_token]What we had in mind here was the use of VGG16's features as a building block for other models (e.g., object detection with SSD).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	128
We performed some preliminary experiments with SSD and a VGG16 backend and found that Slalom could also achieve around 10x speed improvements for such object-detection tasks.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	128

Indeed, as you correctly note, the pre-computation takes the same time as the baseline computation in the TEE.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	128
The results in Section 4.3 do not include this pre-computations as we would of course not obtain any savings by doing so.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	128
[line_break_token]A similar approach is taken by many Cryptographic approaches to secure outsourcing (of ML tasks or other computations).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	128
The rationale is that the pre-computation is data-independent and can be performed offline (e.g., during periods of low system use) and thus doesn't count towards the cost of the online throughput (or latency as discussed above).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	128

B-Review	B-1	Review	523
Recent CVPR papers on transforming samples from source to target should be referred to, one of them was by Shrivastava et al Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training, and another by Bousmalis et al Unsupervised Pixel-level Domain Adaptation with GANs.

Also you might want to mention Domain Separation Networks which uses gradient reversal (Ganin et al) and autoencoders (Ghifary et al).	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
There was no mention of MMD-based methods, on which there are a few papers.	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
The authors might want to mention non-Deep Learning methods also, or that this review relates to neural networks,[line_break_token]* On p. 4 it wasn't clear to me how the semi-supervised tasks by Tarvainen and Laine were different to domain adaptation.	B-Review	B-2	Review	523

We have had to condense our literature review somewhat in order to not go too far over the page limit.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* We have made the distinction between semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation more clear, as the distributions of the source and target datasets are indeed different.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	523
As for having separate source and target mini-batches, we have clarified how this fits in and was inspired by the work of Li et al (2016).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523

[line_break_token][line_break_token]* It seems that Ghifary et al reimplemented Ganin's RevGrad approach.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	523

The paper addresses the problem of domain adaptation: Say you have a source dataset S of labeled examples and you have a target dataset T of unlabeled examples and you want to label examples from the target dataset.	O	O	Review	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The main idea in the paper is to train two parallel networks, a 'teacher network' and a 'student network', where the student network has a loss term that takes into account labeled examples and there is an additional loss term coming from the teacher network that compares the probabilities placed by the two networks on the outputs.	O	O	Review	523
This is motivated by a similar network introduced in the context of semi-supervised learning by Tarvainen and Valpola (2017).	O	O	Review	523
The parameters are then optimized by gradient descent where the weight of the loss-term associated with the unsupervised learning part follows a Gaussian curve (with time).	B-Review	B-1	Review	523
No clear explanation is provided for why this may be a good thing to try.	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
The authors also use other techniques like data augmentation to enhance their algorithms.	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experimental results in the paper are quite nice.	O	O	Review	523
They apply the methodology to various standard vision datasets with noticeable improvements/gains and in one case by including additional tricks manage to better than other methods for VISDA-2017 domain adaptation challenge.	O	O	Review	523
In the latter, the challenge is to use computer-generated labeled examples and use this information to label real photographic images.	O	O	Review	523
The present paper does substantially better than the competition for this challenge.	O	O	Review	523
Thank you for your review.	O	O	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We have clarified our discussion of the Gaussian curve based unsupervised loss scaling that was originally proposed by Laine et al Beyond stating that the scaling function must ramp up slowly they don't discuss their choice of scaling function, so we present it as is.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	523
That said, we would propose replacing it with confidence thresholding, especially as it is more stable that Gaussian ramp-up in more challenging scenarios.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
We have explicitly clarified this in section 3.2	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523

This paper presents a domain adaptation algorithm based on the self-ensembling method proposed by [Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017]. The main idea is to enforce the agreement between the predictions of the teacher and the student classifiers on the target domain samples while training the student to perform well on the source domain.	O	O	Review	523
The teacher network is simply an exponential moving average of different versions of the student network over time.	O	O	Review	523
  [line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros:[line_break_token]+ The paper is well-written and easy to read[line_break_token]+ The proposed method is a natural extension of the mean teacher semi-supervised learning model by [Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017][line_break_token]+ The model achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of visual domain adaptation benchmarks (including top performance in the VisDA17 challenge)[line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons:[line_break_token]- The model is tailored to the image domain as it makes heavy use of the data augmentation.	B-Review	B-1	Review	523
That restricts its applicability quite significantly.	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
I‚Äôm also very interested to know how the proposed method works when no augmentation is employed (for fair comparison with some of the entries in Table 1).	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
[line_break_token]- I‚Äôm not particularly fond of the engineering tricks like confidence thresholding and the class balance loss.	B-Review	B-2	Review	523
They seem to be essential for good performance and thus, in my opinion, reduce the value of the main idea.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
[line_break_token]- Related to the previous point, the final VisDA17 model seems to be engineered too heavily to work well on a particular dataset.	B-Review	B-3	Review	523
I‚Äôm not sure if it provides many interesting insights for the scientific community at large.	I-Review	I-3	Review	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In my opinion, it‚Äôs a borderline paper.	O	O	Review	523
While the best reported quantitative results are quite good, it seems that achieving those requires a significant engineering effort beyond just applying the self-ensembling idea.	O	O	Review	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Notes:[line_break_token]* The paper somewhat breaks the anonymity of the authors by mentioning the ‚Äúwinning entry in the VISDA-2017‚Äù.	B-Review	B-4	Review	523
Maybe it‚Äôs not a big issue but in my opinion it‚Äôs better to remove references to the competition entry.	I-Review	I-4	Review	523

With a view to addressing your concerns, we have run further experiments to quantify the effects of each part of our approach - including data augmentation - for all of the small image benchmarks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
We have therefore removed Table 2 as the information that it presented can be more compactly shown in Table 1, alongside everything else.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
We have added further discussion of the effect of our affine augmentation to section 3.3 and demonstrated its effect on both domain adaptation and plain supervised experiments.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
What we currently have is the same augmentation scheme used by Lain et al and Tarvainen at al, which consists of translations (all) and horizontal flips (CIFAR/STL only).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
Experiments with minimal augmentation (gaussian noise added to the input only, therefore usable outside the image domain) are currently running; we will add them if the experiments complete on time.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Furthermore, we found that our model performs slightly better on the MNIST <-> SVHN experiments when using RGB images rather than greyscale, so we have replaced our greyscale results with RGB ones.	O	O	Reply	523
This represents a slightly bigger domain jump, so we hope that this increases your confidence in our work.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* We see what you mean concerning engineering tricks.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	523
In defence of confidence thresholding, rather than being a new additional trick it replaces a time-dependent ramp-up curve used by Laine et al in their work.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523
We have made this a little more explicit in section 3.3.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523
As for class balancing loss, it is similar in purpose and implementation to the entropy maximisation loss used in the IMSAT model of Hu et al (an unsupervised clustering model that also uses data augmentation).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523

We found that pairing back our augmentation scheme improved performance on the validation set and made little different on the test set.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
Our original complex augmentation scheme was tested on a very small subset (1280 samples) of the training and validation sets during the development of our model.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
It turns out that these results did not generalise to the full set, so lesson learned (we were facing a tight competition deadline too).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
Our new reduced augmentation scheme consists of random crops, random horizontal flips and random uniform scaling, thus bringing it in line with augmentation schemes commonly used in ImageNet networks, such as He et al's ResNets.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Quality: borderline, clarity:good, originality: borderline, significance: good,[line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros:[line_break_token]- The benchmark is set up in a online platform with leaderboard which can be easily accessible to people.	O	O	Review	523
[line_break_token]- The benchmark comes with a diagnostic evaluation dataset with coarse-grained and fine-grained categories that examine different aspect of language understanding abilities.	O	O	Review	523
[line_break_token]- Baseline results for major existing models are provided[line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons:[line_break_token]- The author should provide more detailed analysis and interpretable explanations for the results as opposed to simply stating that the overall performance is better.

[line_break_token]What are the samples that the models failed to perform well?	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
It would be nice to get some more insights and conclusions based on the results obtained from this benchmark to shed some lights on how to improve these models.	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
The results section should be seriously revised.	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The diagnostic evaluation dataset seems to be a way to better understand the model, however, it is hard to see the scope of the data (are the samples under each categories balanced?).	B-Review	B-2	Review	523
Besides, the examples in the dataset seems very confusing even for humans (Table 2).	I-Review	I-2	Review	523

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding the diagnostic data, we do believe much of the information you mention is present in the paper.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	523
For example, we explicitly give the class distribution for the entire dataset (including statistics by category is a good point - we will soon add the class distribution per coarse-grained category), expert annotator agreement (high, at \kappa = 0.73), and human performance (R_3 = 0.8 versus 0.28 for the best model).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523
The last statistic in particular indicates that these examples are understandable and solvable by humans and challenging for existing models.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523

[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree that the diagnostic data is a key contribution of our work.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	523
We wanted to not only have an application-driven measure of progress, but also a targeted measure of performance on specific natural language phenomena that we would expect a general-purpose NLU model to handle well.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding parameter sharing, our intent was to include tasks with very little training data such that automated systems could not do well learning on just those tasks‚Äô data.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	523
Competitive systems, then, would need to include some form of knowledge-sharing from outside data.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523
 In only requiring model predictions to evaluate on test, we wanted to avoid restricting future research to any particular paradigm of knowledge sharing.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523
We use multi-task learning and parameter sharing because it is a straightforward baseline with lots of precedent (GenSen, Collobert and Weston, etc.),	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Could you please clarify how a small *test* set would encourage few-shot learning?	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Re: table 5, we agree!	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	523
We‚Äôll post an updated version of the paper shortly.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	523

The authors address the problem of discovering and predicting with hierarchical structure in data sequences of relevance to planning.	O	O	Review	523
Starting with the kinds of data that have been used recently in video prediction, the authors aim at learning a sequence of keyframes (i.e., subsets of frames forming the overall sequence) that in a suitable sense "summarize" the overall trace.	O	O	Review	523
As they rightly note, many alternate models struggle with making good long term predictions in part because they focus on all levels of prediction equally.	O	O	Review	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The technical approach is to pose the problem as one of inferring the temporal location of each of these key frames and then to interpolate with a model to generate intermediate frames.	O	O	Review	523
One could try to make either step sophisticated - the authors choose to make the keyframe selection more sophisticated and interpolation simpler.	O	O	Review	523
The paper first described the KeyIn model in terms of a probabilistic model of jointly finding the Ks and then the inpainted Is.	O	O	Review	523
This can become delicate, so the authors propose a relaxation that is more forgiving when the keyframe locations are being searched for.	O	O	Review	523
Learning is driven by a reconstruction loss of finding the approximate location, locally interpolating and then seeing if this accords with the training data.	O	O	Review	523
This is all implemented with an LSTM based NN architecture which seems sound to me.	O	O	Review	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I feel the paper is taking on the right kinds of questions, looking for ways to inject the right kind of structure.	O	O	Review	523
I do have some concerns about the overall formulation:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	523
Much of the paper is focussed on rather clean images where nothing extraneous is happening.	B-Review	B-1	Review	523
In reality, the backgrounds of real images is not so benign and other extraneous dynamics might interfere.	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
While I understand this is a step towards the long term goal, I wonder if the end result is a bit too incremental in the absence of some attempt to explore this source of (lack of) robustness.	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	523
In ¬ß6.3, the authors try to demonstrate that the number of keyframes parameter can be wrong by a little bit but these are still small ranges.	B-Review	B-2	Review	523
In realistic images it is likely that the total number of keyframes selected by such an algorithm is much larger due to extraneous events.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
This is why a proper robustness study is crucial on more realistic input.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
As it, in anything other than the trivial dot on black background, the precision-recall numbers are fairly modest.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
This will likely degenerate into noise in most camera-based images of the kind seen by a real robot.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
So, how much confidence should we expect to have in the approach's generality?	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	O	O	Review	523
For the baselines, the true good baseline might have been a human annotation that tells us how people really conceptualise the structure.	B-Review	B-3	Review	523
With data such as pushing, this might not be so different from the simple visual inspection, but again with real data this will vary.	I-Review	I-3	Review	523
The paper would really be much stronger if these were addressed.	I-Review	I-3	Review	523

e thank the reviewer for the helpful comments and suggestions.	O	O	Reply	523
We made the following changes to the submission to address the reviewer's remarks and answer the posed questions.	O	O	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]== robustness in noisy settings ==[line_break_token]We thank the reviewer for drawing attention to the importance of robustness to noise of the kind that exists in real-world domains.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	523
We added an experiment (Tab.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
7 and Fig 11) showing that KeyIn keyframe detection performance is robust to Gaussian image noise, a noise characteristic that is commonly found in real camera sensors [5]. We believe this experiment provides some initial evidence that KeyIn can learn representations that are robust to noise.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
We note that comparable prior work uses environments with little noise and few distractors [1,2,3,4], but we hope that future work will be able to investigate this direction further once the video modeling community matures to the point of using complex real-world data with diverse background activity of the kind the reviewer suggests.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]== Modest precision-recall numbers ==[line_break_token]The reported precision-recall numbers indeed look modest, however, this is largely due to the inherent ambiguity when defining ‚Äútrue‚Äù keyframes.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	523
For example: in the grid-world environment, is the frame where the agent reaches an object or where it interacts with the object the better keyframe?	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523
While we chose one definition of a keyframe, we find that the method often predicts keyframes consistent with another definition, leading to off-by-one errors that are severely penalized by precision-recall metrics.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523
To address this, we added an evaluation that measures minimum temporal distance to the true keyframe in Tab 4, which shows that KeyIn places keyframes closer to the annotated keyframes than all baselines.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523
We also point out that the planning experiments provide a more objective evaluation metric for the quality of keyframes, and we find that KeyIn improves planning performance over all baselines.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]== Human annotation baseline ==[line_break_token]We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	523
We agree that on the current environments the human annotations would not be much different from the ones used to evaluate the models.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
However, for future work that extends KeyIn to more complex environments where it is even harder to define ‚Äúobjective‚Äù keyframes, crowdsourced human annotations will likely be necessary for proper evaluation.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523

This paper introduces a variational objective to train a model which can jointly select keyframes of a video and generate the intervening frames to produce a resultant video.	O	O	Review	523
The model is provided an initial set of frames as context.	O	O	Review	523
At training time the model always learns to produce N*J frames, where N is the number of keyframes and J is a fixed number of frames to generate for each keyframe.	O	O	Review	523
The authors compare their method for selecting informative keyframes on a number of baselines and show an improvement over these baselines.	O	O	Review	523
The problem is interesting and well-motivated, but I have some concerns with the proposed approach and experiments.	O	O	Review	523
As such, I am a weak reject.	O	O	Review	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]comments / questions:[line_break_token]- Equation 3 lacks context.	B-Review	B-1	Review	523
Initially, when looking at the authors' objective it seems that the inner expectation should be taken with respect to the joint time indices for the current and next keyframe.	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
Only later after equation 4 do they mention that they always predict a fixed number of frames J. [line_break_token]- The need for normalizing over the first T timesteps in equation 4 seems quite messy.	B-Review	B-2	Review	523
Is it guaranteed that all of the needed keyframes will actually be within the first T timesteps?	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
How does this work in practice?	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
[line_break_token]- Many important details of the inference procedure are relegated to the appendix.	B-Review	B-3	Review	523
For example, there are no details for extracting which of the 60 keyframes that were trained for a sequence (due to the fixed length sequences) should be selected at test time.	I-Review	I-3	Review	523
Looking at the appendix, it is clear that the approach requires an extensive planning algorithm at inference time, which seems like an important component.	I-Review	I-3	Review	523
[line_break_token]- The authors prominently highlight that their method is fully differentiable, yet they train in two stages while freezing weights.	B-Review	B-4	Review	523
Why isn't the model trained end-to-end?	I-Review	I-4	Review	523
The stated reason for doing so is that this "simple" two-stage procedure improves optimization.	I-Review	I-4	Review	523
What exactly happens if you don't do this two stage training process?	I-Review	I-4	Review	523
Does it fail to learn?	I-Review	I-4	Review	523
Some experimental numbers would be nice to see.	I-Review	I-4	Review	523
[line_break_token]- The authors do not compare their method to any strong keyframe prediction baselines.	B-Review	B-5	Review	523
Considering there is existing work in keyframe prediction, it seems important to highlight the difference between other competing models, rather than relying on simple baselines.	I-Review	I-5	Review	523
Why don't they use self-information/surprisal as a baseline i.e., by training an autoregressive model on the frames and then picking the N frames with the largest -log(p)?	I-Review	I-5	Review	523
This is a metric that has been investigated frequently and has better interpretability than defining a new measure of surprise.	I-Review	I-5	Review	523
Note that Kipf et al (2019) uses this notion of surprisal as well.	I-Review	I-5	Review	523
[line_break_token]- Sauer et al (BMVC 2019) should likely be cited as it does very similar keyframe analysis.	B-Review	B-6	Review	523
Also, as the ICML 2019 conference had already concluded by the ICLR submission deadline, is it really fair to state the work with Kipf et al (2019) was conducted in parallel?	I-Review	I-6	Review	523
[line_break_token]- Why does the model trained to learn a fixed number of timesteps for the intermediate frames?	B-Review	B-7	Review	523
Did they investigate jointly predicting the indices for the current and next timesteps?	I-Review	I-7	Review	523
It seems like it would greatly simplify their inference scheme if they did this.	I-Review	I-7	Review	523
If they tried that approach and it failed, maybe that should be mentioned in the paper (with an explanation as to why it fails).	I-Review	I-7	Review	523
[line_break_token]- In the literature review, when discussing hierarchical temporal structure, the authors state: "However, these models rely on autoregressive techniques for text generation and are not applicable to structured data, such as videos."	B-Review	B-8	Review	523
Autoregressive techniques have been investigated in relation to videos; in fact, the authors later describe papers that have used autoregressive techniques for modeling videos.	I-Review	I-8	Review	523
[line_break_token]	O	O	Review	523
e thank the reviewer for the useful comments and suggestions.	O	O	Reply	523

There appear to be several critical points of misunderstanding, which we will try to clarify.	O	O	Reply	523

[line_break_token][line_break_token]We next address the reviewer‚Äôs concerns, numbered by the order in which they appear in the review, starting with the most crucial.	O	O	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]==  1, 7.	O	O	Reply	523
Predict J intermediate frames?	O	O	Reply	523
==[line_break_token]The number of frames between two keyframes is not fixed - it is given by the variable tau as explained in Sec.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	523
3.1, eqs (1, 2).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
However, in practice, the number of frames between the keyframes is indeed bounded by J (for computational reasons).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
We note that at training time, we always generate all J frames as the timestep distribution tau in general has non-zero mass at each timestep.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
However, at test time we only predict argmax(tau) intermediate frames.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]== 3.	O	O	Reply	523
Missing details of inference?	O	O	Reply	523
Planning needed for inference?	O	O	Reply	523
==[line_break_token]We interpret the question as asking about the test time procedure of the model (rather than the variational inference procedure we use).	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	523
At test time, we can use our model in three different ways, to (1) generate a sequence given conditioning frames, as described in Sec 3.1, (2) infer the keyframes of a sequence, by using the inference network described in Sec 3.2, or (3) perform planning to reach a goal as described in Sec 6.4.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
We suspect the reviewer‚Äôs question is about (1), which is performed as follows.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
We sample the latents from the prior distribution p(z|I_co), generate the corresponding keyframes K and their indices tau, and use the inpainter network to generate the rest of the sequence.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
We note that the planning algorithm described in the appendix is used for motion planning as part of (3) and is not a part of the training.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
Planning is not required for (1) or (2).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]== 5.	O	O	Reply	523
Why this surprisal metric?	O	O	Reply	523
==[line_break_token]As the reviewer points out, our original surprisal metric is not the same as the traditional log(p).	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	523
While a lower bound on log(p) can be computed by summing the reconstruction and the KL-divergence loss, we only used the KL-divergence part.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	523
We have now added a version of the baseline that computes the full lower bound as well as the version from Denton&amp;Fergus‚Äô18 suggested by R1.	O	O	Reply	523
In Tabs.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	523
3, 4, we find that these new versions of the surprise baseline perform comparably to the one we originally reported, and our method outperforms all of them.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	523

The paper introduces a model trained for video prediction hierarchically: a series of significant frames called ‚Äúkeyframes‚Äù in the paper are first predicted and then intermediate frames between keyframes couples are generated.	O	O	Review	523
The training criterion is maximum likelihood with a variational approximation.	O	O	Review	523
Experiments are performed on 3 different video datasets and the evaluation is performed for 3 tasks: keyframe detection, frame prediction and planning in robot videos.	O	O	Review	523
[line_break_token]The idea of generating an abstraction or a summary of a video via a sequence of important frames is attractive and could probably be used in different contexts.	O	O	Review	523
The proposed model is new and the authors introduce some clever ideas in order to train it.	O	O	Review	523
The evaluation work is important and the authors propose different settings for this evaluation.	O	O	Review	523
[line_break_token]The paper also present weaknesses.	O	O	Review	523
First the motivation for keyframes generation should be better developed: the model does not perform better than baselines for video frames prediction so that keyframes generation should be motivated by other applications.	B-Review	B-1	Review	523
Planning as proposed by the authors could be one, but in this case it should be more developed.	I-Review	I-1	Review	523
The main weakness is however the technical presentation which is painful to follow.	B-Review	B-2	Review	523
When it is possible to get a general picture of what is done, it is quite difficult to figure out exactly how the model works.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
A global rewriting and maybe a better focus are required for publication.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
The probabilistic model (section 3.1) is relatively clear, even if it could be improved.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
It seems that the generation of a keyframe and the prediction of the corresponding time (tau^n)  are independent (eq.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
3).	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
This could be commented.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
Also it seems that in eq.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
3 the log(K|z..) term should be inside an expectation.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
Section 4 was difficult to decipher for me.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
My understanding is that instead of sampling from a multinomial during training, you bypass this non differentiable operation by using what you call ‚Äúsoft targets‚Äù thus obtaining a differentiable objective (eq.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
4).	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
Is that true?	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
In any case, the procedure should be made a lot clearer.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
The ‚Äúintermediate frame‚Äù passage also remained confuse for me.	I-Review	I-2	Review	523
[line_break_token]Considering the experiments, the authors make an important effort in order to evaluate different aspects of their model.	B-Review	B-3	Review	523
In a fisrt step, they evaluate the ability of the model to generate significant keyframes using a detection setting.	I-Review	I-3	Review	523
 It is not clear how they define ground truth frames for this evaluation.	I-Review	I-3	Review	523
Those ground truth frames are defined as the frames where the movement in the image changes, which is easy on the Brownian movement dataset but what about the others?	I-Review	I-3	Review	523
Also the baselines used in this comparison are weak.	I-Review	I-3	Review	523
In the paper of Denton, they suggest some way to detect surprise and apparently this is not what you used.	I-Review	I-3	Review	523
This should be justified/ commented.	O	O	Review	523
For keyframe modeling the proposed model behaves similarly to the baselines and even performs worse than the simpler ‚Äújumpy‚Äù model.	B-Review	B-4	Review	523
Concerni g the paragraph about the selection of the number of predicted keyframes, it is not clear what is the reference (ground truth) number of target keyframes.	I-Review	I-4	Review	523
[line_break_token] The planning experiments are interesting, but difficult to follow at least from the main text.	O	O	Review	523
[line_break_token]Overall, I think that there are several interesting ideas and realizations.	O	O	Review	523
They should be better put in perspective and explained.	O	O	Review	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]----- post rebuttal -----------[line_break_token][line_break_token]Thanks for the detailed answer.	O	O	Review	523
The paper is largely improved both for the style and the comparisons.	O	O	Review	523

[line_break_token][line_break_token]== Motivation should be better developed ==[line_break_token]We thank the reviewer for pointing out a possible confusion about the motivation of the paper.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	523
We tried to highlight in the original submission that the goal of this work is not to improve video prediction quality but instead to discover meaningful temporal structure in sequences.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
As the reviewer notes, one possible application for the temporal structure discovered by our model is predicting subgoals for efficient long-horizon planning, and we now expanded the introduction to discuss this.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
We note that planning is known to be a challenging task [1-4] and we show that our model is able to outperform strong baselines using the learned temporal abstraction.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]== Keyframe detection baseline weak, use Denton&amp;Fergus‚Äô18 ==[line_break_token] We thank the reviewer for proposing this alternative comparison.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	523
In the original submission we used a measure of surprise based on the KL divergence (see Sec.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
6.3, details in appendix, Sec.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
F).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
To support the strength of this baseline we have now added two baseline evaluations using alternative definitions of surprise.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
The first uses the method of Denton&amp;Fergus‚Äô18 that the reviewer proposed.	O	O	Reply	523
The second uses the lower bound on the log-likelihood -log(p) instead of just the KL divergence to measure surprise.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	523
In Tab 3,4, we find that the KL-based baseline reported in the submission consistently performs on par with these alternative formulations, and that our method outperforms all baselines.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	523
[line_break_token][line_break_token]== No performance gain on keyframe modeling ==[line_break_token]We understand that the reviewer is referring to the results evaluating image sequence prediction quality (as opposed to keyframe prediction quality).	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	523
It is true that our method does not improve performance on video modeling, but we emphasize that it is able to perform on par with recent work (Denton&amp;Fergus‚Äô18) while additionally discovering the keyframe structure of the sequence.	O	O	Reply	523
Please refer to our answer to the first question about motivation.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	523
We additionally performed an experiment showing that our model‚Äôs ability to model keyframes (i.e. the most important frames) is superior to the baseline methods that do not discover temporal structure in Tab.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	523

# Review[line_break_token]This paper proposes a quantitative evaluation for decoder-based generative models that use Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) to estimate log-likelihoods.	O	O	Review	225
Quantitative evaluations are indeed much needed since for some models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMNs), qualitative evaluation of samples is still frequently used to assess their generative capability.	O	O	Review	225
Even though, there exist quantitative evaluations like Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), the authors show how AIS is more accurate than KDE and how it can be used to perform fine-grained comparison between generative models (GAN, GMMs and Variational Autoencoders (VAE)).	O	O	Review	225
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors report empirical results comparing two different decoder architectures that were both trained, on the continuous MNIST dataset, using the VAE, GAN and GMMN objectives.	O	O	Review	225
They also trained an Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) on binarized MNIST and show that, in this case, the IWAE bound underestimates the true log-likelihoods by at least 1 nat (which is significant for this dataset) according to the AIS evaluation of the same model.	O	O	Review	225

Summary:[line_break_token]This paper describes how to estimate log-likelihoods of currently popular decoder-based generative models using annealed importance sampling (AIS) and HMC.	O	O	Review	225

[line_break_token]In section 2.3 the authors seem to make a mistake.	B-Review	B-2	Review	225

Does a model A overfit relative to a another model B if the test accuracy of A is higher than that of B even though the gap between train and test accuracy is also higher for B than for A. I think not.	I-Review	I-4	Review	225
Perhaps the last sentence on page 8 should say that VAE-50 underfits less than GMMN-50?	I-Review	I-4	Review	225

A model underfits if it fails to model the structure in the training set.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	225
Despite the names, the two are not mutually exclusive, i.e. a given model can both overfit and underfit the data. (	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	225
For instance, if a network somehow memorized 50% of the training examples and ignored the other 50%, it would both overfit and underfit, as reflected in poor likelihood on the training set coupled with a large gap between training and test.)	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	225

The paper tries to learn temporally stable representations for point-based data sets and focus on varying size and dynamic point sets, and demonstrate its usefulness in the context of super-resolution.	O	O	Review	225
To deal with a difficult target that dynamically moves and deforms over time with variable input and output size, they take a novel temporal loss function for temporally coherent point set generation and siamese network setup for temporal loss calculation.	O	O	Review	225

Except spatial loss is considered, taking the ground truth acceleration and estimated velocity into account is beneficial to this task.	O	O	Review	225

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Slow input movement:[line_break_token]- When generating point clouds without temporal constraints, one of the biggest problems is a high frequency jittering that occurs due to accumulated small scale inference errors.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	225

The paper addresses the task of learning temporally stable features for point clouds with an application to upsampling point clouds.	O	O	Review	225
Learning point-based descriptors has been a major topic of research in the recent vision and graphics meetings, where approaches have been proposed focusing semantic labeling, geometry-oriented tasks (e.g. normal estimation), and point-based graphics.	O	O	Review	225
However, as the paper states, and to the best of my knowledge, no methods have been proposed to learn features in fourth dimension in a temporally stable way.	O	O	Review	225
Thus, the very topic of research is significantly novel and promising.	O	O	Review	225
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors consider a combination of loss functions and train a neural point-based network to learn the features.	O	O	Review	225
To stabilize training, the authors carefully study the effect of a series of loss functions, including well-known EMD, losses ensuring slow changes in positions, velocities, and accelerations, as well as a mingling loss to ensure a more uniform spatial point distribution on the output shape.	O	O	Review	225
The studied losses are very logical to implement as one aims to ensure that the output should satisfy a temporally smooth motion pattern.	O	O	Review	225
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experimental results provide a clear view of the proposed approach and demonstrate that combining the studied objectives function with a known point-based learning approach leads to a temporally stable feature representation per-point.	O	O	Review	225
An ablation study further helps to validate the proposed approaches step-by-step.	O	O	Review	225
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To sum up, I believe paper should clearly be accepted, as (1) the work addresses a novel point-based learning task, (2) the research methodology is convincingly presented, and (3) the results provide a clear demonstration of the feasibility of the proposed task.

Summary:[line_break_token]This paper proposed a deep network for point cloud sequence super-resolution/upsampling.	O	O	Review	225
Building on the basis of pointNet and PU-net, the main contribution of the paper is identifying the problem of temporal incoherence in the process of upsampling a point cloud shape representation as well as a training loss to encourage temporal coherence.	O	O	Review	225
In the cases showed in the paper, the proposed method seems effective comparing to previous work which is not done on sequence data.	O	O	Review	225
My main concern about the work is that the experimental evaluation is limited.	O	O	Review	225
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Strengths:[line_break_token]Interesting problem and novel idea.	O	O	Review	225
[line_break_token]The proposed method is technically sound.	O	O	Review	225
From the provided results, the newly introduced training loss seems effective: the result sequences are visually more plausible and smooth.	O	O	Review	225

We have tested our method in other settings, and the performance of these 400+ frames is representative.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	225
Furthermore, the network used for all 3D tests was trained only once, which illustrates how well our network generalizes.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	225
[line_break_token][line_break_token]It is also worth noting that due to the patch-based nature of our approach, the input data correlates only partially.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	225
While the changes look simple to our eyes, the network has to deal with many non-trivial temporal changes in the inputs (the isolated patch examples in our videos illustrate this).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	225

We performed an evaluation based on your comments: we use an animated mesh as a basis to compute ground truth reference points over time, and project the generated point positions onto the mesh.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	225
In this way we can establish a correlation between the generated point clouds, and calculate how much the change in position of the points corresponds to the ground-truth velocity and acceleration.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	225
Additionally, we also evaluate the point density, which is a good indicator of temporal stability, as it should be as uniform as possible.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	225
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Velocity and acceleration are computed via the 1st and 2nd derivative of the predicted positions to the ground-truth position.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	225

Summary: the paper introduces a new way of fine-tuning neural networks.	O	O	Review	184
Instead of re-training the whole model or fine-tuning the last few layers, the authors propose to fine-tune a small set of model patches that affect the network at different layers.	O	O	Review	184

Summary:[line_break_token]       The authors take two tasks,sentiment analysis and natural language inference, and identify datasets for them which they counterfactually augment it by asking people over the Amazon Mechanical Turk Platform to change either the sentiment (in the case of sentiment analysis) or the nature of relationship in the NLI task by making minimal changes to the text that produce the targeted changes.	O	O	Review	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Authors find that popular models trained on either fail on the other dataset while the models trained on both actually generalize much better.	O	O	Review	184
This is because the original sample and its counterfactual pair the label changed , has the difference in the text that matters to the change and this pair could reduce spurious correlations that models might find in the data distribution.	O	O	Review	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros: [line_break_token] This is a very interesting experiment and certainly the dataset that will be released would be extremely valuable to the community.	O	O	Review	184
The one part (I dont have much NLP background but I do have a causality background) that I like most is that the new text generated are counterfactual in some real sense with respect to a real world generating process - that is people modifying text with changed targets.	O	O	Review	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token] A lot of existing work that claim to do counterfactual changes do not specify assumptions about the generating mechanism.	O	O	Review	184
For counterfactuals to be valid they have to be intervention on the actual generating mechanism (or an assumed one) acting on a given unit (latent) that produced the current sample.	O	O	Review	184
The paper in that respect (even if it does not explicitly specify relationship between counterfactuals and generating mechanisms) tries to be faithful to a "strict causal notion" by actually asking people to modify the text.	O	O	Review	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons:[line_break_token]    - I think the authors want to make an explicit connection to counterfactuals as understood in the causality community.	B-Review	B-1	Review	184

This paper addresses the problem of building models for NLP tasks that are robust against spurious correlations in the data by introducing a human-in-the-loop method: annotators are asked to modify data-points minimally in order to change the label.	O	O	Review	184
 They refer to this process as counterfactual augmentation.	O	O	Review	184
 The authors apply this method to the IMDB sentiment dataset and to SNLI and show (among other things) that many models cannot generalize from the original dataset to the counterfactually-augmented one.	O	O	Review	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This contribution is timely and addresses a very important problem that needs to be addressed in order to build more robust NLP systems.	O	O	Review	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Because, however, of a few limitations, I recommend weak acceptance.	O	O	Review	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My main hesitation comes from a lack of clarity about the main lesson we have learned.	B-Review	B-1	Review	184
 In particular, if the goal is to use this method to augment the data we use to train NLP systems in order to make them more robust, it seems that the time cost of the process will be prohibitive.	I-Review	I-1	Review	184
 On the other hand, perhaps these methods could be used to identify the kind of spurious correlations that models tend to rely on, which could then be used in a more automated data augmentation process.	I-Review	I-1	Review	184
 If that's the goal, however, a more detailed error analysis would need to be included.	I-Review	I-1	Review	184

 For instance, a reason that hypothesis-only models do well is that certain words are very predictive of certain labels (e.g. "not" and contradiction).	I-Review	I-2	Review	184
 Do people leave the negations in when modifying such examples for entailment or neutrality, thus breaking the simple correspondence?	I-Review	I-2	Review	184
 That's a very simple kind of question; more generally, I'd like to see more analysis of the new dataset.	I-Review	I-2	Review	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* The BiLSTM they use is very small (embedding and hidden dimension 50).	B-Review	B-3	Review	184
 Given that BERT is most robust against their manipulation, it would be good to see a more powerful recurrent model for comparison.	I-Review	I-3	Review	184
 It would be easy to use ELMo here, if the main question is about Transformers vs recurrent models.	I-Review	I-3	Review	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Some very minor / typographic comments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]* abstract: "with revise" should be "with revising"[line_break_token]* first paragraph page 2: some references to causality literature and definition of spuriousness as common cause[line_break_token]* page 2, "We show that..." I'd break this into two sentences to make it easier to parse.	O	O	Review	184
[line_break_token]* Table 3: I would make two columns for each model with accuracy on original versus revised.	B-Review	B-4	Review	184
 With the current table, one has to compare cells in the top half of the table to those in the bottom half of the table, which is quite difficult to do.	I-Review	I-4	Review	184
hanks for the detailed and thoughtful review.	O	O	Reply	184
We are glad that you think of this paper as a timely contribution addressing an important problem that must be addressed in order to build more robust NLP systems.	O	O	Reply	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree with your point that it would be great to have a practical takeaway guiding practitioners for what to do in practice.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	184
We believe that the first step here is to characterize the problem coherently and that having laid this groundwork, one immediate next step is, as you suggest, to develop a more practical solution that requires a less expensive/onerous annotation effort.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The key contribution of our paper is to provide a clear characterization of a variety of concerns in the language of interventions and to demonstrate that indeed, they can be addressed by acquiring interventional data.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	184
The knowledge that (i) NLP models trained on counterfactually augmented data suffer less from these problems and (ii) transport better out of sample (see new results in the updated draft, per R3‚Äôs suggestion) validates this.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As you mentioned, our solution requires significant expenditure (both financial and human capital) compared to simply labeling data.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	184
As a follow-up, for existing datasets, our next steps include investigating how to make these adjustments in a cost-effective way.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	184
In preliminary work, we have been investigating how to use humans in the loop more effectively.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	184
One approach involves using generative models to propose candidate substitutions and relying on humans only accept or reject the revisions (vs having to write them from scratch).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	184
Our experience with crowdsourcing suggests that this feedback would be significantly cheaper to collect (provided that a reasonable fraction of suggestions were appropriate).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We additionally note that for some tasks, such as NLI, creating new datasets already requires annotators to synthesize examples de novo and the fractional increase for soliciting counterfactually-augmented data might not be as onerous as compared to tasks where the default is to rely on annotators only for tags.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We are also appreciative of your constructive suggestions to improve the paper, and have taken several steps to improve the draft.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	184
These include updating the draft to include (i) a detailed analysis of edits performed on SNLI, (ii) results on various datasets using an ELMo based classifier; (iii) concerning your question about larger Bi-LSTMs, we had tried a large Bi-LSTM but it overfit badly.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	184

The authors propose a new way to augment textual datasets for the task of sentiment analysis, in order to help the learning methods to generalize better by concentrating on learning the different that makes a difference.	O	O	Review	184

In this way, all spurious factors will naturally cancel out.	O	O	Review	184
The authors use the newly created datasets and show that indeed, the retrained algorithms on the augmented datasets generalize much better.	O	O	Review	184

[line_break_token][line_break_token]While degrees of novelty and the relevant sorts of novelty are a matter of opinion we respectfully assert our view that new ideas, the new resource that we present, and the scientific insights derived from our experiments, are precisely the sorts of novelty that should be sought by conferences.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Additionally we point out that the resource is not the only novel idea here.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	184
Of chief importance here is the intellectual contribution casting the problem of learning ‚Äúsuperficial associations‚Äù coherently in the language of intervention, and producing a dataset that addresses counterfactuals in a real sense (as pointed out more eloquently by R1).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	184
Moreover, our experiments shed insights about the price to be paid for relying less on spurious associations and our updated experiments (inspired by R3‚Äôs suggestions) show that our methods result in improved performance out-of-sample on a variety of datasets.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	184

This paper seeks to separate "causal" features from ones with spurious correlations in the context of natural language machine learning tasks.	O	O	Review	184
The proposed approach is to ask human annotators to alter examples in a minimal way that changes the label.	O	O	Review	184
Thereby the humans separate out the causal features (those changed) from the spurious or irrelevant features (those left unchanged).	O	O	Review	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experiments show that classifiers trained on the original data perform poorly on the altered data and vice versa, but (unsurprisingly) training on the union of the two datasets results in a classifier that performs well in both cases.	O	O	Review	184
Furthermore, training an SVM on the original results in irrelevant attributes (such as movie genre) being weighted, whereas these weights are largely removed when training on the union of the datasets.	O	O	Review	184
This suggests that the augmented training data results in weighting the "right" features more.&nbsp;[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, I think this paper should be accepted because it makes several interesting contributions: It proposes an interesting approach, shows intriguing experimental results, and produces an interesting dataset (size ~2k) that may be useful for future testing.	O	O	Review	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The main limitation of the paper is that the evidence is largely circumstantial.	B-Review	B-1	Review	184
The method has intuitive appeal and the experimental results are suggestive, but the experiments do not conclusively show that the method achieves something that ordinary machine learning does not.	I-Review	I-1	Review	184
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My suggestion for a further experiment would be to apply the movie review classifiers to, say, book reviews -- something where the task is fundamentally the same but the context is different.	B-Review	B-2	Review	184
If the classifier trained on the union of the original and altered datasets performs better than a classifier trained on only on dataset, then that is strong evidence that this approach yields better extrapolation.	I-Review	I-2	Review	184

The work assumes that the knowledge base associated with the dialog task has en entity-to-entity-relationship format and can be naturally expressed as a graph.	O	O	Review	1359
The dependency tree of dialog utterances can also be expressed as a graph, and the dialog history as a set of graphs.	O	O	Review	1359
To utilize this structure, the proposed method uses GCNs whose lowest layer embeddings are initialized with the entity embeddings or via outputs of standard RNN-like models.	O	O	Review	1359
The main claim is that the proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art on a goal-oriented dialog task.	O	O	Review	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The idea of explicitly modeling the relational structure via GCNs is interesting.	B-Review	B-1	Review	1359
However, the use of GCNs independently per sentence and per knowledge-base is a bit disappointing, since it does not couple these sources of information in a structured way.	I-Review	I-1	Review	1359
Instead, from my current understanding, the approach merely obtains better representations for each of these sources of information, in the same way it is done in the related language tasks.	I-Review	I-1	Review	1359
For instance, have you considered passing information across the trees in the history as well?	I-Review	I-1	Review	1359
Or aligning the parsed query elements with the KB elements?	I-Review	I-1	Review	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The results are very good.	B-Review	B-2	Review	1359
That said, a source of concern is that the model is only evaluated as a whole, without showing which modification brought the improvements.	I-Review	I-2	Review	1359
The comparison between using/not using RNNs to initiate the first GCN layer is promising, but why not compare to using only RNN also?	I-Review	I-2	Review	1359
Why not compare the various encoders within an established framework (e.g. without the newly introduced attention mechanism)?	I-Review	I-2	Review	1359
Finally, the attention mechanism, stated as a contribution, is not motivated well.	I-Review	I-2	Review	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Clarity:[line_break_token]The notation is described well, but it's not terribly intuitive (the query embedding is denoted by c, the history embedding by a, etc.),	B-Review	B-3	Review	1359

hard to follow.	I-Review	I-3	Review	1359
A figure would have made things easier to follow, esp.	I-Review	I-3	Review	1359
due to the complexity of the model.	I-Review	I-3	Review	1359
A clearer parallel with previous methods would also improve the paper: is the proposed approach adding GCN on top of an established pipeline?	I-Review	I-3	Review	1359
Why not?	I-Review	I-3	Review	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]More discussion on code-mixed language, e.g. in section 4.6, would also improve clarity a bit (make the paper more self-contained).	B-Review	B-4	Review	1359
While the concept is clear from the context, it would be helpful to describe the level of structure in the mixed language.	I-Review	I-4	Review	1359
For instance, can dependency trees not be obtained code-mixed languages?	I-Review	I-4	Review	1359
Is there any research in this direction? (	I-Review	I-4	Review	1359
or is the concept very new?)	I-Review	I-4	Review	1359
Maybe I am just missing the background here, but it seems helpful in order to asses how appropriate the selected heuristic (based on the co-occurence matrix) is.	I-Review	I-4	Review	1359

We must confess that while we had some of these on our to-do list, there were a few that we hadn't actually thought of.	O	O	Reply	1359
We have now been able to add these experiments and we believe it has definitely helped us improve the quality of the paper.	O	O	Reply	1359
Below we give a pointwise update about the new experiments.	O	O	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1)Passing information across the KB tree and query/history tree by aligning query/history elements with the KB elements: We were able to implement this and did a thorough hyperparameter tuning across all languages.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	1359
We have included these results in the paper (RNN+CROSS-GCN-SeA in Tables 1, 2) but the short summary is that there was not much change in the BLEU, ROUGE and per response accuracy and only a marginal improvement in the Entity F1-score for En-DSTC2 and Ta-DSTC2.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1359
We had expected the entity F1-score to improve significantly across all languages since we are explicitly linking entities in the KB with entities in the query/history but unfortunately this was not the case.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1359
Initial analysis suggests that given that the task is relatively simple, even the base model, which does not explicitly pass information across the trees, is still able to capture the relevant information.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2)Ablation tests including comparisons with basic RNN based models and basic attention models: This was a bad miss on our part but now we have been able to do a thorough ablation study with the following experiments where we try to evaluate the (i) need for GCNs (ii) need for our sequential attention mechanism and (iii) need for combining RNNs with GCN:[line_break_token][line_break_token]a)RNN with attention (the basic seq2seq+attention model of Bahdanau et al 2015)[line_break_token]b)GCN with Bahdanau attention [does not use RNN or our sequential attention][line_break_token]c)RNN+GCN with Bahdanau attention [does not use our sequential attention][line_break_token]d)RNN with our sequential attention [does not use GCNs][line_break_token]e)RNN+GCN with our sequential attention [Our Final Model][line_break_token][line_break_token]We have included these results for all languages in the updated version of the paper (see Table 8 in Appendix D and ‚ÄúAblations‚Äù part of Section 6) and the main observations are summarized below:[line_break_token][line_break_token]i)GCNs do not outperform RNNs independently: In general, the performance of GCN-Bahdanau attention < RNN-Bahdanau attention[line_break_token]ii)Our sequential attention outperforms Bahdanau attention:  In general, the performance of GCN-Bahdanau attention < GCN-our_seq_attention, RNN-Bahdanau attention < RNN-our_seq_attention and RNN+GCN-Bahdanau attention < RNN+GCN-our_seq_attention.	O	O	Reply	1359
However, note that RNN-Bahdanau attention < RNN-our_seq_attention holds for BLEU and all ROUGE metrics but not for Entity F1 and exact match accuracy.	O	O	Reply	1359
We are analyzing this further and will hopefully be able to add some insights in the final version of the paper.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	1359
[line_break_token]iii)Combining GCNs with RNNs helps: In general, RNN-our_seq_attention < RNN+GCN-our_seq_attention[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, the best results are always obtained by our final model which combines RNN, GCN and sequential attention.	O	O	Reply	1359
Also, the code for our model and these ablation studies will be made publicly available.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3)Motivation behind attention: The motivation behind using a sequential attention mechanism was as follows: The current utterance which we refer to as query sets the stage for what comes next (the response).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1359
Hence we use this query to attend to only important parts in the history (essentially, the history can be long and we just want to focus on things which are relevant for the last utterance).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1359
Once, we have identified relevant portions of the history and computed an attention weighted representation for the history we are now ready to identify the important concepts from the KB.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1359
To achieve this effect we use the sequential attention mechanism.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4)GCN on top of an established pipeline: experiment c in point 2 above.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]5)Better notations and figures: Indeed, in hindsight, we agree that some of our choices were not very intuitive.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	1359
We have added 2 diagrams which hopefully makes things clear.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	1359
It would be great if you can give us a feedback on the diagrams.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]6)Clarity on code-mixing: The statistics about the level of code mixing, level of structure, etc are mentioned in the original paper (Banerjee et al 2018) which introduced the dataset.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	1359
As suggested, to make the paper self-contained we have added the important statistics in this paper and some examples of code mixed conversations from the dataset (Appendix A).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1359
Note that there is a lot of work on processing code mixed text (for example, POS tagging of code mixed text, sentiment analysis of code mixed text, information retrieval using code mixed queries, etc).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1359
However, there is not much work on code mixed dialogues because this dataset was only released recently (COLING 2018).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1359
To the best of our knowledge, there is no work on building parsers for code mixed languages which produce parse trees.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1359

B-Review	B-1	Review	1359
The paper is clearly written, and the results seem promising.	I-Review	I-1	Review	1359
However, as the paper combines existing mechanisms to design a model for dialog, the novelty seems to be relatively weak.	I-Review	I-1	Review	1359
[line_break_token]In particular, I felt that some experimental results are required to verify some of the arguments put forward by the authors.	B-Review	B-2	Review	1359
We listed two issues as below.	I-Review	I-2	Review	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	1359
Effects of GCN[line_break_token]The authors show that RNN-GCN-SeA can make state-of-the-art performance, but not how much GCN makes effects on improving the performance on the dialog task.	B-Review	B-3	Review	1359
[line_break_token]I think the authors need to compare the results of RNN-GCN-SeA with a model without GCN (i.e. RNN-SeA) in order to show that exploiting the structural information of dependency and contextual graphs do play an important role.	B-Review	B-4	Review	1359
[line_break_token]The random graph experiments (Table 3) show the effect of good structure in GCN, but I felt that it is not enough to demonstrate an improvement by GCNs.	B-Review	B-5	Review	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	1359

We would like to thank you for suggesting additional experiments for improving the paper.	O	O	Reply	1359
We have been able to run these experiments and would like to update you about the results:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) Effects of GCN: We have now added detailed ablation studies (please see Table 8 in Appendix D) including comparisons with basic RNN based models and basic attention models.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	1359
In particular, we have now compared RNN+GCN-SeA with RNN-SeA. The results indeed suggest that adding GCNs on top of RNNs helps.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	1359
Our analysis also shows that our sequential attention outperforms the basic (Bahdanau) attention.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	1359
Please see ‚ÄúAblations‚Äù part of Section 6 and Table 8 in Appendix D. Also, the code for our model and these ablation studies will be made publicly available.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) Comparative experiments: We have reported Entity F1 scores for all our experiments and again find that w.r.t this metric our model mostly outperforms existing approaches (including some new baselines that we have added for the ablation study).	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	1359
We were not very keen on the bAbI dataset since existing research ( Hybrid Code Networks, Williams et al, 2017 ) shows that it is possible to achieve 100% performance on this dataset using simple models (not surprising given that this is a synthetic dataset).	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1359
Hence, there is not much scope for introducing more complex models such as the one proposed in this paper.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1359
We plan to include results on the In-Car dataset and we are hopeful that we will have these results ready in the final version of the paper.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) Yes, indeed, Mem2Seq does not outperform seq2seq in all experiments.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	1359
In that sense, you are correct in saying that it is not a SOTA model.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	1359
By SOTA, we incorrectly meant that it is the most recent model published on this dataset.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4) Copy mechanism: In addition to the Mem2Seq model of (Madotto et al, 2018), we have now added the comparison with the model of (Eric and Manning, 2017) which uses copy mechanism.	B-Reply	B-8	Reply	1359
Our model outperforms both these models.	I-Reply	I-8	Reply	1359
In principle, we should be able to augment our model with a copy mechanism but this may be a non-trivial extension of our model.	I-Reply	I-8	Reply	1359
This is definitely worth trying but we are not sure if we will be able to add this to the current version of the paper.	I-Reply	I-8	Reply	1359

This is a well-written paper (especially the introduction) with fairly extensive experimentation section.	O	O	Review	1359

It would be infomative to furhter describe this work and clearly state how you handle things differenclty, since a Q&A system is quite close to a dialogue one.	O	O	Review	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]There are some parts that could be made more clear.	B-Review	B-2	Review	1359
For example, when you mention that you collectively represent all trees as a single graph.	I-Review	I-2	Review	1359
How do you do that?	I-Review	I-2	Review	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The model has a great number of parameters.	B-Review	B-3	Review	1359
It is not clear to me how you concluded to the specific parameter values.	I-Review	I-3	Review	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]It would be nice to add the complexity of the model and also be more specific about how you choose the parameter values.	B-Review	B-4	Review	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My proposals are:[line_break_token][line_break_token]I think that the paper would greatly benefit if you additionally to the equations you also presented the model in a graphical way as well.	B-Review	B-5	Review	1359
Additionally, although the paper is very well mathematically defined, is not so easy to follow from a practical perspective.	I-Review	I-5	Review	1359
For example, regarding section 5.3 I would prefer to see the 3 models you present in a graphical way as well.	I-Review	I-5	Review	1359

Below, we provide updates on some of the improvements that we have been able to do:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) Difference from QA:  To the best of our knowledge, the only work on using GCNs for QA (De Cao et al, 2018) uses Entity graphs as opposed to dependency graphs used in the work.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	1359
An entity graph essentially draws an edge between same entities which appear in different sentences whereas a dependency graph contains semantic edges.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1359
Hence, the graph that we are operating on is very different from the entity graph used in the above paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1359
Further, in the case of QA, there is a query and a document whereas in our case there is a context/history in addition to the query and KB.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1359
This adds some more complexity to our model.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1359
For example, our sequential attention mechanism also considers the history while paying attention to the KB.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1359
Further, it also computes a query aware representation for the history.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1359
Finally, while producing the output, the decoder also pays attention to the history.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1359
These differences are not groundbreaking but we just mention them here to make the distinction between the two tasks clear and to highlight the additional components in our model.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) How do we collectively represent all trees as a graph?	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	1359
This was in the context of computing a representation for the dialogue history.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1359
The history contains multiple sentences.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1359
We first create a dependency tree for each sentence.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1359
The final graph for the history is a simple collection of these individual (disconnected) trees.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1359
Just to be clear, currently we do not have any edges between words in two different sentences (hence all the individual sentence trees are disconnected from each other).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) Regarding complexity and choosing parameter values: Our final model (RNN+GCN-SeA) has ~4M parameters as compared to the vanilla RNN+attention model which has ~2M parameters.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	1359
These parameters were learned using ADAM, with a batch size of 32 and initial learning rate of 0.0006.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1359
We found that the model trains in ~30 epochs.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1359
In addition, we would like to clarify that the hyperparameters of the model were chosen using a validation set.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4) Clarity: Indeed, in hindsight and based on similar comments by Reviewer 1, we agree that we could have made things more clear by adding a diagram.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	1359
We have included 2 diagrams in the updated version of the paper and we hope it clarifies things.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	1359
Regarding the three models in Section 5.3, they would only differ in the type of parse tree edges (last edge type in the legend) shown in Figure 1.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	1359
Please give us your feedback on the diagrams and if it can be improved to make things more clear.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	1359
[line_break_token][line_break_token]5) Link to Dataset: We used the dataset released by Banerjee et al, 2018 which is available at the following URL: <a href="https://github.com/sumanbanerjee1/Code-Mixed-Dialog" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/sumanbanerjee1/Code-Mixed-Dialog</a> .

We have fixed them in the updated version of the paper.	I-Reply	I-8	Reply	1359

This paper presents an simple and interesting idea to improve the performance for neural nets.	O	O	Review	511
The idea is we can reduce the precision for activations and increase the number of filters, and is able to achieve better memory usage (reduced).	O	O	Review	511
The paper is aiming to solve a practical problem, and has done some solid research work to validate that.	O	O	Review	511
 In particular, this paper has also presented a indepth study on AlexNet with very comprehensive results and has validated the usefulness of this approach.	O	O	Review	511
  [line_break_token][line_break_token]In addition, in their experiments, they have demonstrated pretty solid experimental results, on AlexNet and even deeper nets such as the state of the art Resnet.	O	O	Review	511
The results are convincing to me.	O	O	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]On the other side, the idea of this paper does not seem extremely interesting to me, especially many decisions are quite natural to me, and it looks more like a very empirical practical study.	B-Review	B-1	Review	511
So the novelty is limited.	I-Review	I-1	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]So overall given limited novelty but the paper presents useful results, I would recommend borderline leaning towards reject.	O	O	Review	511
Thank you for the comments.	O	O	Reply	511
We defend the novelty aspect of this paper in our response below.	O	O	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Novelty:[line_break_token]Our paper targets quantization at no accuracy loss.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	511
We target network training on reduced precision hardware (H/W) considering a system-wide approach - system and on-chip memory footprint of activations is much more than weights.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token]For cloud-based inference deployments (where large batch-size is typical) and during training, reducing precision of activations speeds up end-to-end runtime much more than reducing the precision of weights (Fig.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511

[line_break_token]However, as our paper shows, reducing activation precision hurts accuracy much more than reducing weight precision.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
No prior work targets this aspect.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Most prior works on reduced precision DNNs sacrifice accuracy and many prior works target reducing precision of just the weights.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
We show that there is no tradeoff in reducing precision - even during training - one can get the same accuracy as baseline by making the networks wider (yes, more raw compute operations, but still the compute cost is lower than baseline).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
We believe lowering precision is one aspect (which is widely studied in literature) but it is important to lower precision without any loss in accuracy - no prior work has shown reduced-precision network (4-bits, 2-bits) training and inference without sacrificing accuracy.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token]Also, our results with binary networks are state-of-the art and close the gap significantly between binary and 32b precision (e.g. less than 1.2% for ResNet-34).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
We believe widening networks is a simple technique (which works) that is easy for programmers to experiment with for recovering accuracy with reduced precision.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
With WRPN: (a) model-size is smaller and, (b) run time and energy for end-to-end inference as well as training is lower than 32b networks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]With widening, the number of neurons in a layer increase.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
Yet with reduced precision, we control overfitting and regularization.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511

It focuses on an approach to get similar accuracy at lower precision, in addition to cutting down the compute costs.	O	O	Review	511
Results with 2-bit activations and 4-bit weights seem to match baseline accuracy across the models listed in the paper.	O	O	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Originality[line_break_token]This seems to be first paper that consistently matches baseline results below int-8 accuracy, and shows a promising future direction.	O	O	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Significance[line_break_token]Going down to below 8-bits and potentially all the way down to binary (1-bit weights and activations) is a promising direction for future hardware design.	O	O	Review	511
It has the potential to give good results at lower compute and more significantly in providing a lower power option, which is the biggest constraint for higher compute today.	O	O	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros:[line_break_token]- Positive results with low precision (4-bit, 2-bit and even 1-bit)[line_break_token]- Moving the state of the art in low precision forward[line_break_token]- Strong potential impact, especially on constrained power environments (but not limited to them)[line_break_token]- Uses same hyperparameters as original training, making the process of using this much simpler.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Effect on compute of not quantizing first layer and last:[line_break_token]The total number of FMA operations in first and last layer is ~3% for ResNet-34 (and 1.5% for ResNet-50).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	511
So the effect on overall compute is smaller for these layers if not negligible.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
In our work, the first layer and last layer's weights and activations are not quantized and neither are these layers' width increased.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For the first and last layer, we find, we can quantize the weights to 8-bits (at most) without much loss in accuracy compared to keeping them at full-precision (~0.2% additional accuracy loss) while quantizing the other layers to 4bits activations and 2-bits weight.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
So, in theory we can use integer compute for these layers if not 2-bits and 4-bits precision to speed up compute.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The primary reason we did not quantize the first and last layer is because - we wanted to fairly compare against prior proposals - the works we compared against in the paper do not quantize these layers.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]At what widening factor does 1-bit come at-par with baseline full-precision?	O	O	Reply	511
[line_break_token]Our very preliminary results tell us that this could probably happen at 3.5x-4x widening.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	511
[line_break_token]We run into experimental evaluation issues when doing these experiments -- making the layers wider blows up the device memory requirements (since we "emulate" the binary and other low-precision knobs with FP32 precision in GPUs).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511
We are working on performing these experiments with distributed TensorFlow set-up.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511
The other aspect is to lower the batch-size and still use a single node set-up but we have to change the learning rates then	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511

The paper studies the effect of reduced precision weights and activations on the performance, memory and computation cost of deep networks and proposes a quantization scheme and wide filters to offset the accuracy lost due to the reduced precision.	O	O	Review	511
The study is performed on AlexNet, ResNet and Inception on the Imagenet datasets and results show that accuracy matching the full precision baselines can be obtained by widening the filters on the networks.	O	O	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Positives[line_break_token]- Using lower precision activations to save memory and compute seems new and widening the filter sizes seems to recover the accuracy lost due to the lower precision.	O	O	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Negatives[line_break_token]- While the exhaustive analysis is extremely useful the overall technical contribution of the paper that of widening the networks is fairly small.	B-Review	B-1	Review	511
[line_break_token]- The paper motivates the need for reduced precision weights from the perspective of saving memory footprint when using large batches.	B-Review	B-3	Review	511
However, the results are more focused on compute cost.	I-Review	I-3	Review	511
Also large batches are used mainly during training where memory is generally not a huge issue.	I-Review	I-3	Review	511
Memory critical situations such as inference on mobile phones can be largely mitigated by using smaller batch sizes.	I-Review	I-3	Review	511
It might help to emphasize the speed-up in compute more in the contributions.	I-Review	I-3	Review	511

Overall we believe ours is a simple technique that works and that is easier for programmers to adopt.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We will clearly articulate the speed-up in compute for the final version of the paper.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	511
Specializing the hardware (e.g. by adding compute components that implement 2-bits, 4-bits, binary, 8bits, etc.)	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511
 would definitely speed-up inference times.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511
Our ASIC and FPGA evaluations (Section-5.1) are an attempt to highlight this aspect.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511
Current hardware platforms are not optimized for 2-bits and 4-bits.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511
One other aspect of lowering memory footprint is that the working set size of the workload starts to fit on chip and by lowering accesses to DRAM memory, the compute core starts to see better performance and energy savings (DRAM accesses are expensive in latency and energy).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511

This work proposes a brand new dataset to fill in the vacancy of current conversational AI community, specifically the introduced dataset aims at providing a platform to perform large-scaled knowledge-grounded chit-chat.	O	O	Review	511
Overall, the dataset is well-motivated and well-designed, its existence will potentially benefit the community and inspire more effective methods to leverage external knowledge into dialog system.	O	O	Review	511
Besides, the paper also utilizes many trending models like Transformers, Memory Networks, etc to ensure the state-of-the-art performance.	O	O	Review	511

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Here are some questions I want to raise about the paper:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	511
First of all, the design of the conversation flow though looks reasonable, but it is pretty uncommon for a human to ground his/her every sentence on external knowledges.	B-Review	B-1	Review	511
Therefore, it would probably be better to introduce some random ungrounded turns into the conversation to make it more humanlike.	I-Review	I-1	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	511
Secondly, the whole framework is based on many modules and every one of them are prone to error.	B-Review	B-2	Review	511
I‚Äôm afraid that such cascaded errors will accumulate and lead to compromised performance in the end.	I-Review	I-2	Review	511
Have you thought about using REINFORCE[line_break_token]algorithm to alleviate this issue?	I-Review	I-2	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	O	O	Review	511
Finally, it would be better to introduce some noisy or adversarial apprentice to raise unrelated turns and see how the system react.	B-Review	B-3	Review	511
Have you thought about how to deal with such cases?	I-Review	I-3	Review	511
Thank you for your review and detailed feedback.	O	O	Reply	511
We address your 3 points below:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- ‚Äúit is pretty uncommon for a human to ground his/her every sentence on external knowledges‚Äù:  [line_break_token]    o  In fact in our task, at any time in the dialogue the Wizard can choose ‚Äúno sentence used instead‚Äù, as stated in the paper, but we have made this clearer (adding it in two places).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	511
We do agree that the Wizard task is not completely natural for a human as we are trying to make the human conversationalist help to train our bot maximally by grounding their sentences so that we can learn how to ground ‚Äî for this reason we ask the human to read Wikipedia sentences and use them if possible rather than their own personal knowledge (which the model cannot retrieve).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
It is this setup that we believe makes our dataset so useful for knowledge grounded dialogue model training compared to existing datasets.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- REINFORCE for learning the whole system:  [line_break_token]    o  Indeed our methods do use at least two modules: one for knowledge retrieval (searches over all of Wikipedia), and one that combines knowledge selection and generation/retrieval.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	511
Training the parts of the system together, e.g. by REINFORCE is a great idea for future work.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511

[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Noisy or adversarial apprentice: [line_break_token]    o  Again, making the systems more robust is also a good direction for future work.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	511

This paper collects a new annotated dataset for knowledge grounded dialog task.	O	O	Review	511
The proposed models combine two recent neural networks, Memory Net and Transformer, for the purpose of the task.	O	O	Review	511
I highly appreciate the efforts to collect such a precious dialog dataset for the community.	O	O	Review	511
Also, the setup in data collection actually narrows down the scope of chitchat dialog into a specific topic by grounding it to a set of knowledge.	O	O	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Here are summaries of my concerns and questions about the paper.	O	O	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]# applicability of the knowledgeable bot[line_break_token]What is the basic motivation of this work?	B-Review	B-1	Review	511
Once you develop a chatbot that can produce a response grounded by knowledge, how could it be applied to real-world applications?	I-Review	I-1	Review	511
Are you trying to teach a student who is looking for more knowledge about a topic?	I-Review	I-1	Review	511
If so, you should be more careful about what knowledge the student (or apprentice in the paper) knows or don‚Äôt know about the topic and how their knowledge models dynamically change over the chat.	I-Review	I-1	Review	511
Otherwise, the proposed model seems a simple knowledge retrieval model given the dialog context.	I-Review	I-1	Review	511
Would you please provide motivations of the work?	I-Review	I-1	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]# No explicit goal of a dialog makes the chat divergent and open-ended[line_break_token]Without a specific goal given to the annotators or a restriction in the instruction, a dialog in the current setting might diverge beyond the context.	B-Review	B-2	Review	511
For example, if an apprentice says about her/his personal opinion about the topic (e.g., I hate the Gouda cheese) or past experience (e.g., I went to a music festival by Michael Jackson 23 years ago), then how do you control the chat between two annotators or how do you train a model not to pay much attention on out-of-topic utterances?	I-Review	I-2	Review	511
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]# Lack of further analysis of the dataset[line_break_token]Data collection part itself seems to be the biggest contribution to this work.	B-Review	B-3	Review	511
Why don‚Äôt you bring one of real dialog example in Figure 3 to the main paper and say more about it?	I-Review	I-3	Review	511
For example, what other interesting applications can you develop on this dataset?	I-Review	I-3	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Compared to the Wizard, the role of apprentice seems unclear to me.	B-Review	B-4	Review	511
I found from the examples in Figure 3 that most of the apprentices‚Äô responses are a follow-up question about the knowledge, a personal agreement or feeling or their preference.	I-Review	I-4	Review	511
Do you have any post analysis on the types of responses from the apprentices so highlighting utilities of the dataset in a real application?	B-Review	B-5	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]# Some questions on data collection[line_break_token]Do you have any incentive mechanism to make annotators more engage in the dialog?	O	O	Review	511
[line_break_token]Did you filter out some bad dialogs?	B-Review	B-6	Review	511
Then, how did you measure the quality of a dialog?	I-Review	I-6	Review	511
[line_break_token]How do you penalize bad annotators that often make aggressive words or don‚Äôt follow the instruction you set up?	I-Review	I-6	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]# A question on the model[line_break_token]Compared to previous works such as (Zhang at al.,	B-Review	B-7	Review	511
ACL18), the proposed model seems to have the only replacement with Transformer encoder and a loss term for knowledge selection.	I-Review	I-7	Review	511
Have you tried another way of dealing with the knowledge part?	I-Review	I-7	Review	511
For example, a ranking loss might be better than the attention.	I-Review	I-7	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]# Questions on the Experiment section[line_break_token]Any experiment to show the effect of different \lambda value in the loss of the generative model?	B-Review	B-8	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]When you evaluate the generative model, have you also tried other automatic metrics such as BLEU instead of only PPL and Unigram-F1?	B-Review	B-9	Review	511
For this task, the possible response grounded by the topic+knowledge might be too diverse to measure though.	I-Review	I-9	Review	511
Could you possibly add some constraints to the annotators to do some clear tasks over the dialog so you can systematically evaluate the dialog w.r.t the constraint?	I-Review	I-9	Review	511
Otherwise, evaluation of this task seems to be mostly the same as chitchat systems.	I-Review	I-9	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In Table 5, human evaluators only measure the likeness of the dialog which seems very naive.	B-Review	B-10	Review	511
Why don‚Äôt you measure whether the apprentice gets new knowledge of which s/he didn‚Äôt know before, whether the knowledge provided from the model was informative, whether the dialog was fun and engaging or more?	I-Review	I-10	Review	511
The current human evaluation seems very weak though.	I-Review	I-10	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This might be an auxiliary question: have you tried to train the model for apprentice and make two models chat with each other?	B-Review	B-11	Review	511
How does the chat look like then?	I-Review	I-11	Review	511
[line_break_token]	O	O	Review	511

We apologize if our answer is long, but you had a lot of questions!	O	O	Reply	511
We have tried to answer them all and make necessary changes to the paper.	O	O	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Real application: [line_break_token]    o  This task is not meant to be solely a diagnostic dataset, but a basis for a knowledgeable conversational agent that can talk about any knowledge that is in Wikipedia.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	511
We are interested in this task, because an agent that is both knowledgeable and can converse with humans in an engaging way is one of the goals of AI.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
 A successful system could engage with real people (not just paid crowdworkers).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
In our work, the goal is to chat freely about the topic, i.e. a chitchat task.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
 No, we do not aim to make an educational tool as you mention, although others could use our work as a pre-training for such a task perhaps.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
However, we respectfully disagree that our models are ‚Äúa simple knowledge retrieval model given the dialog context‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
Please see e.g. Figures 2 and 4 to show that in the best cases, where our modeling works very well,  particularly the E-book, toga party and Arnold Schwarzenegger examples the agent can be very conversationally engaging ‚Äî it both uses knowledge, but also clearly replies and follows the conversation of  the human partner, producing engaging conversations as measured in human evaluations.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Test-bed for state-of-the-art dialogue models: [line_break_token]    o  Separately, our task is also a challenging setup to develop models that can actually talk in a knowledgeable way to humans.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
They must have a memory (and be able to retrieve knowledge from it), to be able to select that knowledge and converse convincingly with respect to the dialogue context.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
This combines a lot of the current research threads into a single challenging task where grounded knowledge can clearly be leveraged, due to the way the data was collected.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- ‚ÄúNo explicit goal of a dialog makes the chat divergent and open-ended‚Äù: [line_break_token]    o  Yes!	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	511
This is one of the challenges of real dialogue, and our dataset as well.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511
Because our data set collection involves an in-the-loop knowledge retrieval at every dialogue turn during both data collection (and for models working on our task) the human Wizard is able to ground their conversation with knowledge from Wikipedia.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511
That is, if they started talking about cheese, those topics will appear from the retrieval over Wikipedia, but if they switch to Michael Jackson, that will appear too.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511
They are not locked into the original topic, just as in a natural conversation.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511
This is what can make our models more feasibly useful for real chat in an application.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Additional details about the Apprentice: [line_break_token]    o  The Apprentice is a completely unconstrained human, playing the role of a curious learner, eager to chat.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	511
Their stated goal is to go into depth about a chosen topic that interests themselves or their partner, while keeping the conversation engaging and fun.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	511
We observed Apprentices saying statements, asking questions and answering questions, as shown in the examples in Appendix A.2.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	511
Assuming that a question contains a question mark or begins with 'how', 'why', 'who', 'where', 'what' or 'when', in the dataset Apprentices ask questions in 13.9% of training set utterances, and answer questions (i.e., the Wizard has asked a question) 39.5% of the time, while saying new statements (neither asking nor answering a question) 49.3% of the time. (	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	511
Note those percentages don't add up to 100 because a question may be answered with another question.)	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	511
That is, overall, the Apprentice maintains a balanced set of dialogue acts.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	511
We made this clearer in the main text, and added details to the appendix.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- ‚ÄúDo you have any post analysis on the types of responses from the apprentices so highlighting utilities of the dataset in a real application?‚Äù: [line_break_token]    o  Please see the answer above which is now added to the paper.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	511
 We also note that we do provide an analysis of our models in Appendix C, which involves models talking to human Apprentices.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	511
[line_break_token]    o  The dataset statistics are Table 1, examples from human-human conversations are in Fig 3 and examples dialogues of different models are in 2,4 & 5.	O	O	Reply	511
There is unfortunately little room left in the main paper for more, hence they are in the appendix.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	511
We felt it was important to highlight the successes of the models, as to our knowledge there is scant evidence of models working this well in open-domain chitchat before.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	511
 Hence, the majority of our analysis has been on the modeling side (see Appendix C).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	511

This paper introduces a new dataset and method for chatbots.	O	O	Review	511
In contrast to previous work, this paper specifically probes how well a dialogue system can use external unstructured knowledge.	O	O	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Quality:[line_break_token]Overall, this is a very high-quality paper.	O	O	Review	511
The dataset is developed well, the experimental setup is well thought-through and the authors perform many ablation studies to test different model variants.	O	O	Review	511
The main criticism I have would be that the human evaluation is rather simple (rating 1-5), I would have expected more fine-grained categories, especially ones that relate to how much knowledge the system uses (I appreciate the "Wiki F1" metric, but that is an automatic metric).	B-Review	B-1	Review	511
As it is, the human evaluation shows that most of their contributions are not appreciated by human annotators.	I-Review	I-1	Review	511
Further, the paper ends a bit abruptly, I would have expected a more in-depth discussion of next steps.	B-Review	B-2	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Clarity:[line_break_token]The description of the work is clear in most places.	O	O	Review	511
I particularly like the abstract and introduction, which set up the rest of the paper nicely.	O	O	Review	511
In some places, perhaps due to space restrictions, method descriptions are a bit too short.	B-Review	B-3	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Originality:[line_break_token]The paper is fairly original, especially the aspect about specifically using external knowledge.	O	O	Review	511
The authors could have been more clear on how the work differs from other work on non-goal directed dialogue work though (last paragraph of related work section).	B-Review	B-4	Review	511
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Significance:[line_break_token]The dataset is really well-developed, hence I believe many working in the dialogue systems community will re-use the developed benchmark and build on this paper.	O	O	Review	511

Also, it would be good to show ablation results for this.	I-Review	I-12	Review	511
[line_break_token]- Section 5.1: why did you choose to pre-train on the Reddit data?	B-Review	B-13	Review	511

If so, cite.	I-Review	I-14	Review	511

How does it show that?	I-Review	I-14	Review	511
[line_break_token]- Section 5.3: The Wiki F1 score is kind of interesting because it shows to what degree the model uses knowledge.	I-Review	I-14	Review	511
But the side-by-side comparison with the human scores shows that humans don't necessarily prefer chatbot models that use a lot of knowledge.	I-Review	I-14	Review	511
I'd expect this to be discussed, and suggestions for future work to be made accordingly.	I-Review	I-14	Review	511

This should be explained:[line_break_token]    o  Compared to the related datasets we describe in Section 2, our dataset provides specific and high-quality grounding as we ask the Wizard to author dialogue based on the given knowledge (so we know what to ground to later when training models).	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	511
Further, we ask the Wizard to select which sentence the knowledge is from, giving even more fine-grained information.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	511
In those existing tasks the data used to ground was not accessible during dialogue collection, and thus may or may not be related.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	511

Also, why wasn't the whole text used:[line_break_token]    o  In order to keep crowdworkers from being overwhelmed, we chose for the worker to be exposed to no more than 15 different wikipedia articles at once (7 based on the Wizard's previous message, 7 based on the Apprentice's previous message, and 1 for the chosen topic), any higher was too much work to annotate.	B-Reply	B-9	Reply	511
The first ten sentences translated to roughly the first and second paragraphs of the wikipedia topic article, which we felt would be ample information for the conversations.	I-Reply	I-9	Reply	511
We did initially test varying amounts of sentences and articles, and we ultimately settled on these choices as they struck the best balance between keeping a conversation moving while also ensuring the Wizard had enough information to use in a response.	I-Reply	I-9	Reply	511

The paper mainly applies the technique w/ sequence autoencoders (Dai et al 2015) without the usage of attention (i.e., only using the context vector).	B-Review	B-7	Review	381
Experimental results show improvement from author's baseline on some toy tasks.	B-Review	B-6	Review	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]=== Augmentation ===[line_break_token]The augmentation process is simple enough, take the seq2seq context vector and add noise/interpolate/extrapolate to it (Section 3.2).	O	O	Review	381
This reviewer is very curious whether this process will also work in non seq2seq applications.	O	O	Review	381

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors did compare their method on several toy datasets (that are less commonly used in DL literature) and MNIST/CIFAR.	B-Review	B-2	Review	381
The authors show improvement over their own baselines on several toy datasets.	I-Review	I-2	Review	381
The improvement on MNIST/CIFAR over the author's baseline seems marginal at best.	I-Review	I-2	Review	381
The author also didn't cite/compare to the baseline published by Dai et al 2015 for CIFAR -- here they have a much better LSTM baseline of 25% for CIFAR which beats the author's baseline of 32.35% and the author's method of 31.93%.	I-Review	I-2	Review	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experiments would be much more convincing if they did it on seq2seq+MT on say EN-FR or EN-DE.	B-Review	B-3	Review	381
There is almost no excuse why the experiments wasn't run on the MT task, given this is the first application of seq2seq was born from.	I-Review	I-3	Review	381

We wanted to point out a few simplifications in Reviewer 3‚Äôs TLDR statement which we thought unfairly represented the work:[line_break_token]- When R3 said ‚Äúthey add noise to some representation space‚Äù, this incorrectly represents what we did.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	381
We experimented with noise injection, interpolation, and extrapolation in feature space and actually found that adding noise did not work well compared to extrapolation.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	381
[line_break_token]- When R3 said ‚ÄúExperimental results show improvement from author‚Äôs baseline on some toy tasks‚Äù, there are two errors here.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	381
First, our Arabic Digits, Australian Sign Language Signs, and UCFKinect tests all include results that were not our own baselines; they were the best results reported by other groups that we could find on these datasets.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	381
Second, while we completely agree that Arabic Digits, AUSLAN, UCFKinect, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 are not large-scale datasets, calling them toy seems unnecessarily punitive.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	381
Our aim in choosing these datasets was breadth of modalities.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	381
[line_break_token]- We‚Äôre not sure why it was necessary to qualify ‚Äúwithout the usage of attention‚Äù in the TLDR statement as it does not seem relevant to what we are exploring.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree that it would be interesting to explore this approach on Machine Translation (or other text-based applications).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	381
However, neither of the authors have experience in this domain and, to our understanding, most existing approaches require significant infrastructure (in terms of datasets and computational resources).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	381
We weren't able to introduce such a pipeline in the time frame allotted by the review period, but we will certainly consider it in future work.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Dropout on the context vector can be seen as a specific case of our method; it‚Äôs a (severe) kind of noise applied to the feature-mapped inputs.	B-Reply	B-8	Reply	381
We performed some tests by applying dropout to the context vectors and found that it neither increased nor decreased performance significantly.	I-Reply	I-8	Reply	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We acknowledge the discrepancy between the baseline published by Dai et al (26% error vs. our 32% error) and while we believe that we have exactly replicated their approach, we cannot explain the discrepancy.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	381
We reached out to these authors requesting more detail but have yet to receive a response.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	381

The concept of data augmentation in the embedding space is very interesting.	O	O	Review	381
The method is well presented and also justified on different tasks such as spoken digits and image recognition etc.	O	O	Review	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]One comments of the comparison is the use of a simple 2-layer MLP as the baseline model throughout all the tasks.	B-Review	B-1	Review	381
It's not clear whether the gains maintain when a more complex baseline model is used.	O	O	Review	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Another comment is that the augmented context vectors are used for classification, just wondering how does it compare to using the reconstructed inputs.	B-Review	B-2	Review	381
And furthermore, as in Table 4, both input and feature space extrapolation improves the performance, whether these two are complementary or not?	I-Review	I-2	Review	381
Thank you for your positive feedback on the paper and your constructive suggestions.	O	O	Reply	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]With respect to the more complex baseline, since the reviews were received, we experimented with a more state-of-the-art architecture (Wide ResNets by Zagoruyko and Komodakis, 2016) for the CIFAR-10 task.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	381
In all of our tests we held constant the  Wide Residual Network architecture (same as the one used in the Wide ResNets paper) and changed only the data.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	381
We conducted tests on the following 6 setups: [line_break_token]Test 1 ‚Äì 32x32 input with no data augmentation (8.79% test error)[line_break_token]Test 2 - 24x24 center crops with no data augmentation (11.21% test error)[line_break_token]Test 3 - 24x24 center crops, reconstructed from context vectors of the original images, with no data augmentation (18.68% test error)[line_break_token]Test 4 - 24x24 center crops + extrapolation (14.11% test error)[line_break_token]Test 5 - 24x24 with simple data augmentation (shifting and horizontal flipping) (7.33% test error)[line_break_token]Test 6 - 24x24 with simple data augmentation + extrapolation (8.55% test error)[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall performance improved greatly compared to our current sequence autoencoder + MLP results.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	381
In the Test 4 and 6 described above, we used reconstructions of the extrapolated feature vectors (in addition to the original images) to train the classifier.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	381
Although visual inspection of the reconstructions looked to us like valid training cases (i.e. objects maintained their class identity and we saw no visible artifacts) training with reconstructed extrapolated context vectors actually worsened performance.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	381
We also trained a model on only reconstructions of the original examples mapped to context vectors (i.e. no extrapolation) for Test 3.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	381
This test performed considerably worse compared to training on the original examples themselves (Test 2).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	381
Therefore we believe that, at least for CIFAR-10, there is significant loss of fidelity of the examples (original or extrapolated) when mapping to and from context vectors.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	381
We are currently investigating alternative methods that could be used to reduce the amount of error introduced during the reconstruction process,  such as static encoder-decoder architectures or performing extrapolation within the feature space of the classifier itself.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We‚Äôre still in the process of running these experiments, but will add the Wide ResNet results to the final version	O	O	Reply	381

In this paper authors propose a novel data augmentation scheme where instead of augmenting the input data, they augment intermediate feature representations.	O	O	Review	381
 Sequence auto-encoder based features are considered, and random perturbation, feature interpolation, and extrapolation based augmentation are evaluated.	O	O	Review	381

authors baseline.	O	O	Review	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My main questions and suggestions for further strengthening the paper are:[line_break_token][line_break_token]a) The proposed data augmentation approach is applied to a learnt auto-encoder based feature space termed ‚Äòcontext vector‚Äô in the paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	381
 The context vectors are then augmented and used as input to train classification models.	I-Review	I-1	Review	381
Have the authors considered applying their feature space augmentation idea directly to the classification model during training, and applying it to potentially many layers of the model?	I-Review	I-1	Review	381
 Also, have the authors considered convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures as well for feature space augmentation?	I-Review	I-1	Review	381
 CNNs are now the state-of-the-art in many image and sequence classification task, it would be very valuable to see the impact of the proposed approach in that model.	I-Review	I-1	Review	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]b) When interpolation or extrapolation based augmentation was being applied, did the authors also consider utilizing nearby samples from competing classes as well?	B-Review	B-2	Review	381
 Especially in case of extrapolation based augmentation it will be interesting to check if the extrapolated features are closer to competing classes than original ones.	I-Review	I-2	Review	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]c) With random interpolation or nearest neighbor interpolation based augmentation the accuracy seems to degrade pretty consistently.	B-Review	B-3	Review	381
 This is counter-intuitive.	I-Review	I-3	Review	381
 Do the authors have explanation for why the accuracy degraded with interpolation based augmentation?	I-Review	I-3	Review	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]d) The results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 are inconclusive.	B-Review	B-4	Review	381
 For instance the error rate on CIFAR-10 is well below 10% these days, so I think it is hard to draw conclusions based on error rates above 30%.	I-Review	I-4	Review	381
 For MNIST it is surprising to see that data augmentation in the input space substantially degrades the accuracy (1.093% -> 1.477%).	O	O	Review	381
 As mentioned above, I think this will require extending the feature space augmentation idea to CNN based models.	B-Review	B-4	Review	381
Thank you for your valuable suggestions for improving the paper.	O	O	Reply	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]a) This is an interesting suggestion.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	381
In the case where noise is the transformation, this would simply amount to noise injection in the hidden layer (which we know works well as a regularizer).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	381
However, doing interpolation or extrapolation amounts to something that, to the best of our knowledge, hasn't been reported.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	381
For this paper one of our aims was to keep the encoding architecture and transformation in feature space consistent, however, we are very interested in exploring this direction for the next paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]b) Since the reviews were submitted we conducted some tests on utilizing samples from competing classes for extrapolation and interpolation, however we found that both approaches resulted in worse performance compared to the baseline.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]c) We ran some additional synthetic data experiments where we could control the complexity of the class boundaries.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	381
We found that extrapolation helped only in the case where there were complex class boundaries, not when the boundaries were simple (e.g. linearly separable, or one class encircling another).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	381
However, interpolation did help in these simple cases.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	381
Our best explanation at present is that interpolation tends to tighten class boundaries and unnecessarily increase confidence, leading to overfitting.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	381
In essence, it may cause the model to ignore informative extremities that can describe a complex decision boundary and produce an unnecessarily smooth decision boundary.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	381
High-dimensional, real datasets will typically have complex decision boundaries, and this is the case where we found extrapolation to shine.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	381
We have added a discussion on this matter to the conclusion section in the most recent revision of the paper.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]d) Please see our response to Reviewer 1 detailing the use of Wide ResNets	O	O	Reply	381

There are many ways to reduce the memory footprint and increase speed of a neural network: weight quantisation, compression, coarse-to-fine, knowledge distillation, etc.	O	O	Review	381
The method proposed in this work is a specific case of knowledge distillation that focuses on the discrete-input-to-first-layer and output-layer-to-discrete-output transformations, which represent a large portion of the parameters.	O	O	Review	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors propose to use a variant of SVD (which can be viewed as 2 linear transformation, with a middle dimension that represents an embedding), where the first transformation is linear with a ReLu, and the second is linear.	O	O	Review	381
By approximating the learned matrices of the model, the experiments show that using the proposed variant of SVD gives similar predictive performance compared to the original model, with a fraction of the parameters.	O	O	Review	381
[line_break_token][line_break_token]However, it seems that the authors could have simply replaced the input by a 2-layer NN (first a linear+ReLu, then a Linear) to obtain the same parametrisation, but they could have learned the parameters in a end-to-end fashion.	B-Review	B-1	Review	381
It is not clear to me why using a surrogate L2 loss within the model should give better predictive performance than a fully end-to-end trained neural network.	I-Review	I-1	Review	381
Without this comparison, I do not think the proposed experiments are conclusive enough.	I-Review	I-1	Review	381

In the appendix, the authors presented the results for the ablated version which does not consider the relationships.	I-Review	I-1	Review	721
As the authors pointed out, these results are a bit counterintuitive and concluded that FID is not a good metrics for evaluating compositional generation.	I-Review	I-1	Review	721
However, as far as I know, the compositional generation can achieve much better Inception scores on CIFAR-10 in LR-GAN paper (Yang et al).	I-Review	I-1	Review	721
Combining the results on MNIST in LR-GAN paper, I would suspect that the datasets used in this paper are fairly simple and all methods can achieve good results without much efforts.	I-Review	I-1	Review	721
It would be good to show some results on more complicated datasets, such as face images with background, or cifar-10.	I-Review	I-1	Review	721
Also, the authors did not present the qualitative results for independent version of k-GAN.	I-Review	I-1	Review	721
Meanwhile, they missed an ablated human study when the relational modeling is muted.	I-Review	I-1	Review	721
I would like to see how the generated images without modeling relationships look like to humans.	I-Review	I-1	Review	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	721
Following the above comment, I think the datasets used in this paper is relatively simpler.	B-Review	B-2	Review	721
In MM and CLEVR, the foreground objects are digits or simple cubes, spheres or cylinders.	I-Review	I-2	Review	721
Also, the background is also simpler for these two datasets.	I-Review	I-2	Review	721
Though CIFAR10+MM has a more complicated background, it is trivial for the model to distinguish the foregrounds from the backgrounds.	I-Review	I-2	Review	721
Again, the authors should try more complicated datasets.	I-Review	I-2	Review	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	O	O	Review	721
Though the proposed method can model the relationship between objects simultaneously, I doubt its ability to  really being able to disentangle the foregrounds from the backgrounds.	B-Review	B-3	Review	721
Since the background and foregrounds are both whole images, which are then combined with an alpha blending, the model cannot discover the conceptually different properties for foreground and background that foregrounds are usually small than background and scattered at various locations.	I-Review	I-3	Review	721
Actually, this has been partially demonstrated by Figure 4.	I-Review	I-3	Review	721
In the last row, we can find one sphere is in the background image.	I-Review	I-3	Review	721
I tend to think the proposed model performs similar to Kwak & Zhang's paper without a strong proof for the authors that the relational modeling plays an important role in the model.	O	O	Review	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4.	B-Review	B-3	Review	721
It would be nice to perform more analysis on the trained k-GAN.	B-Review	B-4	Review	721
Given the training set, like MM or CLEVR, I am wondering whether k-GAN can learn some reasonable relationship from the datasets.	I-Review	I-4	Review	721
That is, whether it is smart enough to infer the right location for each objet by considering the others.	I-Review	I-4	Review	721
This analysis can be performed, how much occlusions the generated images have compared with the real images.	I-Review	I-4	Review	721
For example, on CLEVR, I noticed from the appendix that the generated CLEVR images base on k-GAN actually have some severe occlusions/overlaps.	I-Review	I-4	Review	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Summary][line_break_token][line_break_token]In this paper, the authors proposed an interesting method for image generation compositionally.	O	O	Review	721
Instead of modeling the generation process recurrently, the authors proposed to model the relationships simultaneously in the hidden vector space.	O	O	Review	721
This way, the model can generate multiple foreground objects and backgrounds more flexibly.	O	O	Review	721
However, as pointed above, the paper missed some experiment, ablation study and analysis to demonstrate the relational modeling in the image generation.	O	O	Review	721
The author need to either try more complicated images or add deeper analysis on the recent experimental results.	O	O	Review	721

First, real-world images are to a large degree compositional, and a generative model that is suitable equipped with a corresponding inductive bias should be better at capturing this distribution.	O	O	Reply	721

[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the following we will answer each of your comments.	O	O	Reply	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token](1) Our conclusion regarding FID arises from the way the Inception network (that provides the embedding) was trained.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	721
In particular, by training on ImageNet for single-object classification it is unlikely that deep layers (eg.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
logits or final max-pool) provide high-level features that capture properties of multiple objects accurately.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
In particular, it suggests that FID is limited in accurately evaluating generated images containing multiple objects, even though it is accurate in evaluating generative models on ImageNet (or related single-object tasks like CIFAR10, etc.)	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
as shown in [4]. Similarly, this does not preclude LR-GAN (or other compositional approaches) from using FID on ImageNet or CIFAR10.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]On the contrary, we compute FID on multi-object images using an inception network that was pre-trained on single-object images (ImageNet).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
We are interested in verifying that the generated images are faithful with respect to the training distribution in terms of the number of objects, their identities, etc.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
To the best of our knowledge FID has not been used in this way previously.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
LR-GAN [5] evaluates the Inception score only on MNIST-ONE and not on MNIST-TWO, although they conclude that it is unsuitable even in the single object case (see Appendix 6.3).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
Based on our own observations in using FID on multi-object datasets (as summarised in Figure 9) we argue that FID is unable to judge generated images based on specific properties relating to multiple objects (eg.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
their total number, etc.).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
The large differences that are observed in evaluating the subjective quality (human eval - Figure 6a) for models with similar FID provide additional evidence that this is the case.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token](2) In this work we are interested generating scenes as compositions of objects, and in particular in verifying that this information can be disentangled at a representation level.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	721
This requires evaluation on datasets for which a clear notion of ‚Äúobject‚Äù is available.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721
Compared to prior work that has focused primarily on the representation learning part (eg. [	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721
1, 2, 3]), we focus on scaling these insights to more complex multi-object datasets.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We would like to emphasize that relevant prior work has only focused on Multi-MNIST [1, 2, 3], Shapes [2, 3], and Textured MNIST [3]. In this work we consider several more complex datasets, including two relational version of Multi-MNIST (triplet, rgb), a variation on CIFAR10 that has RGB MNIST digits in the foreground, and high-resolution CLEVR images that contain many rendered geometric objects and require lighting and shadows to be modeled.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Ideally we would be able to apply our approach to common segmentation datasets (eg.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721
Pascal VOC, COCO) although in practice we find that these are still far out of reach for purely unsupervised approaches.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721
Such datasets have been designed with access to ground-truth labels in mind and the large imbalance between the visual complexity of objects (i.e. intra-class variation) and the number of samples renders them unsuitable for our purpose.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721
We consider CLEVR to be among the more complex multi-object datasets that are balanced in this way, and hence the feasibility of our approach on this dataset is an important step forward compared to prior work	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721

This paper explores compositional image generation.	O	O	Review	721
Specifically, from a set of latent noises, the relationship between the objects is modelled using an attention mechanism to generate a new set of latent representations encoding the relationship.	O	O	Review	721
A generator then creates objects separately from each of these (including alpha channels).	O	O	Review	721
A separate generator creates the background.	O	O	Review	721
The objects and background are finally combined in a final image using alpha composition.	O	O	Review	721
An independent setting is also explored, where the objects are directly sampled from a set of random latent noises.	O	O	Review	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My main concern is that the ideas, while interesting, are not novel, the method not clearly motivated, and the paper fails to convince.	B-Review	B-1	Review	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]It is interesting to see that the model was able to somewhat disentangle the objects from the background.	B-Review	B-2	Review	721
However, overall, the experimental setting is not fully convincing.	I-Review	I-2	Review	721
The generators seem to generate more than one object, or backgrounds that do contain objects.	I-Review	I-2	Review	721
The datasets, in particular, seem overly simplistic, with background easily distinguishable from the objects.	I-Review	I-2	Review	721
A positive point is that all experimented are ran with 5 different seeds.	I-Review	I-2	Review	721
The expensive human evaluation used does not provide full understanding and do not seem to establish the superiority of the proposed method.	I-Review	I-2	Review	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The very related work by Azadi et al on compositional GAN, while mentioned, is not sufficiently critiqued or adequately compared to within the context of this work.	B-Review	B-3	Review	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The choice of an attention mechanism to model relationship seems arbitrary and perhaps overly complicated for simply creating a set of latent noises.	B-Review	B-4	Review	721
What happens if a simple MLP is used?	I-Review	I-4	Review	721
Is there any prior imposed on the scene created?	I-Review	I-4	Review	721
Or on the way the objects should interact?	I-Review	I-4	Review	721
[line_break_token]On the implementation side, what MLP is used, how are its parameters validated?	B-Review	B-5	Review	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]What is the observed distribution of the final latent vectors?	B-Review	B-6	Review	721
How does this affect the generation process?	I-Review	I-6	Review	721
Does the generator use all the latent variables or only those with highest magnitude?	I-Review	I-6	Review	721
[line_break_token]The attention mechanism has a gate, effectively adding in the original noise to the output ‚Äî is this a weighted sum?	B-Review	B-7	Review	721
If so, how are the coefficient determined, if not, have the authors tried?	I-Review	I-7	Review	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper goes over the recommended length (still within the limit) but still fails to include some important details ‚Äîmainly about the implementation‚Äî while some of the content could be shortened or moved to the appendix.	B-Review	B-8	Review	721
Vague, unsubstantiated claims, such as that structure of deep generative models of images is determined by the inductive bias of the neural network are not really explained and do not bring much to the paper.	I-Review	I-8	Review	721
Thank you for your feedback and consideration.	O	O	Reply	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the following we first provide an overview of the main answers regarding your main concern that ‚Äú... the ideas, while interesting, are not novel, the method not clearly motivated, and the paper fails to convince‚Äù before proceeding to a detailed discussion: [line_break_token][line_break_token]* Compositionality is critical in reducing complex visual scenes to a set of primitives (objects) that can be re-combined freely to generate new scenes (combinatorial productivity).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	721
There is substantial empirical evidence that neural networks can benefit from this in image processing tasks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
[line_break_token]* The novelty of our approach is in combining insights from unsupervised multi-object image processing (representation learning) with GANs that have proven useful in generating complex images.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
[line_break_token]* The datasets that we consider are non-trivial and substantially more complex compared to relevant related work that only considers variations of Multi-MNIST.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
Our results on CLEVR already significantly advance upon the state of the art in terms of unsupervised multi-object image-processing.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
[line_break_token]* The experimental evaluation is sound and the reported results are representative for the model performance: it consistently generates images as a composition of individual objects.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
[line_break_token]* Compared to a strong baseline of GANs we find that the generated images are of higher quality, and more faithful to the reference distribution, as confirmed by a large scale human study.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Detailed answers below:[line_break_token][line_break_token]The primary motivation of this work is to argue for object compositionality in deep generative models (and in particularly GANs), which originates from two key observations.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
First, real-world images are to a large degree compositional, and a generative model that is suitable equipped with a corresponding inductive bias should be better at capturing this distribution.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
Second, in disentangling information content corresponding to different objects at a representational level they may be recovered a posteriori unlike in unstructured models.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In our experiments we find that the proposed model is successful in doing both: it generates images of higher-quality that are more faithful to the reference distribution (as per human evaluation), and it consistently disentangles information content belonging to different objects (visual inspection).	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We would like to emphasize this last part, and point out that the reported images in Figures 3 & 4 are representative of how the best performing models generate the scene.	O	O	Reply	721
In other words, on all datasets we consistently find that the network generates the images as a composition of individual objects.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	721
Indeed on CLEVR we found cases in which a component generates more than one object, which is understood by the fact that the number of components is smaller than the number of objects in the scene (see also Figure 8 in Appendix A).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721
We also find infrequent cases (primarily on CLEVR, although sometimes on CIFAR10) in which the background generator generates an additional object.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721
This is understandable as there are no restrictions in our approach that prevent it from doing so.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721
However, given that in almost all other cases the network generate images as compositions of objects and background it seems reasonable to conclude that these are due to optimization issues (as are common in GANs).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721
After all, the compositional solution is clearly the superior choice, as is evident from our human evaluation compared to regular GAN.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The proposed framework combines insights from related work in multi-object image generation and relational reasoning.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	721
There is substantial evidence that object compositionality is beneficial in a variety of image-related tasks, although purely unsupervised approaches (in particular those targeted at discovering object representations) have only been evaluated on toy datasets.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	721
GANs have been shown to scale to complex images, and the proposed approach demonstrates that a combination of these ideas is fruitful.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	721
More specifically, our contributions are (1) an implementation of recent insights from unsupervised multi-object image processing in the GAN framework, (2) strong evidence that a deep generative model may learn about objects purely through the process of generation (i.e. without a ‚Äúdecoder‚Äù), (3) strong evidence that object compositionality benefits the quality and properties of generated images, and (4) strong evidence that these ideas can be scaled to more complex datasets in using GANs	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	721

The paper proposes a compositional generative model for GANs.	O	O	Review	721
Basically, assuming existence of K objects in the image, the paper creates a latent representation for each object as well as a latent representation for the background.	O	O	Review	721
To model the relation between objects, the paper utilizes the multi-head dot-product attention (MHDPA) due to Vaswani et a. 2017.	O	O	Review	721
Applying MHDPA to the K latent representations results in K new latent representations.	O	O	Review	721
The K new representations are then fed into a generator to synthesize an image containing one object.	O	O	Review	721
The K images together with the synthesized background image are then combined together to form the final image.	O	O	Review	721
The paper compares to the proposed approach to the standard GAN approach.	O	O	Review	721
The reported superior performance suggest the inductive bias of compositionality of scene leads to improved performance.	O	O	Review	721
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The method presented in the paper is a sensible approach and is overall interesting.	O	O	Review	721
The experiment results clearly shows the advantage of the proposed method.	O	O	Review	721
However, the paper does have several weak points.	O	O	Review	721

For example, what would be the performance difference if one replace the MHDPA with LSTM.	I-Review	I-1	Review	721
Another weak point is that it is unclear if the proposed method can be generalize to handle more complicated scene such as COCO images as the experiments are all conducted using very toy-like image datasets.	B-Review	B-2	Review	721

In this paper the authors present a differentiable objective for slow feature analysis, to facilitate end-to-end training.	O	O	Review	1533

 Nevertheless, the approximate whitening layer and the way it is used is a smart approach for this problem.	O	O	Review	1533

 In summary, the paper may lack technical novelty in some respect, but the experiments are convincing in terms of proof-of-concept, and the approach is smart.	B-Review	B-2	Review	1533

Dear Reviewer,[line_break_token][line_break_token]Your intuition is right, the objective function itself is not novel and is indeed straightforward to derive.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	1533
In fact, it is just an unordered version of the original SFA loss (which is in itself differentiable already).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1533
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The whole novelty lies in the idea of using the described whitening layer, thus, incorporating the constraints in the model rather than the loss function.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1533
The paper you mentioned can be seen as doing the latter.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1533
Thus, we understand it to fall in line with "Bergstra, J. and Bengio, Y. - Slow, decorrelated features for pretraining complex celllike networks" where a penalty term for covariances is included in the loss function.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1533
Futhermore, the probabilistic model by Turner and Sahani is not optimized by gradient-descent, but trained by the Expectation Maximization algorithm.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1533

Summary[line_break_token]The manuscript proposes to use power iterations in an approximate "whitening layer" to optimize the slowness objective of SFA in a very general setting.	O	O	Review	1533
A set of experiments illustrates that this way of doing nonlinear SFA is meaningful.	O	O	Review	1533
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Quality[line_break_token]Although the idea is pretty straight forward and the paper shows qualitative results on a number of datasets, the relative merit of the approach is empirically not well characterized.	B-Review	B-1	Review	1533
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Clarity[line_break_token]The manuscript is in general well written and the technical content is well accessible.	B-Review	B-2	Review	1533
However the description of the whitening layer implementation needs some more details.	I-Review	I-2	Review	1533
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Originality[line_break_token]The idea of using a whitening layer together with the slowness objective has not been explored before.	B-Review	B-3	Review	1533
There is a second ICLR 2019 submission (Pfau et al) with a very similar idea, though.	I-Review	I-3	Review	1533

[line_break_token][line_break_token]On Empirical Evaluation & Quality:[line_break_token]We included an experiment on the synthetic dataset investigating the progression of average correlation and slowness for an increasing number of power iterations.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	1533
Surprisingly, there seems to be no trade-off, but too low a number of power iterations will result in sub-optimal performance even if the average correlation is already low.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1533
We describe this qualitatively in the section on the experiments using synthetic data, and we included the progression plots for both metrics in the Appendix.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1533
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Also, in Section 6.1, we conducted new experiments with non-linear models (a quadratic expansion network, common for non-linear SFA, and a multi-layer perceptron) on a non-linearly distorted version of the synthetic data.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	1533

[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]On Originality:[line_break_token]We tried to make the differences between the mentioned work and ours more visible.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	1533
While both papers are aiming to solve a similar problem, our method relies mainly on an simple architectural change (which is, however, applicable independently of the objective), while SpINs are theoretically derived directly from a more general problem formulation and their success stems from a smart optimization of a loss that enforces the constraints.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	1533
We do see distinct merit in both approaches.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	1533
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]On Details:[line_break_token]a) The noise is a precautionary measure as closed-form SFA can have the problem of breaking due to linear dependencies in the data, and we do sample the data-generating coefficients randomly.	B-Reply	B-9	Reply	1533
While the current version of MDP (the framework we used for closed-form SFA) available on github includes methods to deal with this problem, the initial experiments have been conducted with the version published on PyPI which does not have this feature yet.	I-Reply	I-9	Reply	1533

This paper gives an alternative to best-first search ("BFS"), plus heuristics, planning of molecules synthesis.	O	O	Review	110
It does so by training a policy network on ECFP4 (string encoding) representations of molecules, to predict which (sub)molecule to apply, with rewards +1 when the molecule to synthetize is complete, -1 if this branch of applications is complete and the synthesis failed, 0 otherwise.	O	O	Review	110
As far as I understood, it is trained in _retro_synthesis (decompose the molecule).	O	O	Review	110
This policy network is coupled to a search method (BFS of MCTS) both to reduce the branching factor, and to aggressively prune the validation of chemical rules (graph isomorphism).	O	O	Review	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The details about the policy model are almost inexistant.	B-Review	B-1	Review	110
The run-time of MCTS seems more than twice longer than that of BFS, so, baring an explanation, it feels like those should be compared in wall clock time.	B-Review	B-2	Review	110
The "random" test set selection may be problematic to ensure that the whole model is working properly: you may want to test in generalization, on end-result (==start in retrosynthesis) molecules that are unknown to the policy network.	I-Review	I-2	Review	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]"essentially the complete published knowledge of chemistry":[line_break_token]1) Paywall :([line_break_token]2) maybe you are talking about a specific subset of organic chemistry?	B-Review	B-3	Review	110
Even then, I doubt this includes all metabolic pathways and/or protein foldings.	I-Review	I-3	Review	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The rest of the paper seems reasonable.	O	O	Review	110

Chemical synthesis planning is a long-standing and important problem.	O	O	Review	110
While not the first to propose machine learning to model an 'expert chemist' for chemical synthesis, the particular reinforcement learning approach with MCTS in this work is novel as far as I know.	O	O	Review	110
However, I have a couple questions and concerns.	O	O	Review	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Primarily, not enough information is given about the training data or the policy network trained from it.	B-Review	B-1	Review	110
In general, good chemistry data is hard to obtain; information tends to be scattered, in different formats, and of varying quality.	I-Review	I-1	Review	110
So I'm skeptical about the claim that the data set contains "essentially the complete published knowledge of chemistry."	I-Review	I-1	Review	110
What are these reactions, how are they represented, and how do you determine the _best_ move for a particular molecule when training?	I-Review	I-1	Review	110
For the policy network, what is the network architecture?	I-Review	I-1	Review	110
These may have been published elsewhere, but more details should be provided here, especially for a machine learning audience.	I-Review	I-1	Review	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I don't completely understand the performance improvement due to the MCTS.	B-Review	B-2	Review	110
It seems less useful in this application than in Go, because here whenever you reach a reward of Q(v)=1, the problem is solved and you stop.	I-Review	I-2	Review	110
In the experiments, MCTS shows an improvement over BFS+NN, which is definitely interesting, but this doesn't account for the fact that BFS is more than twice as fast (due to searching the tree in order?).	I-Review	I-2	Review	110
If the constraint was wall-clock time, would MCTS still outperform BFS?	I-Review	I-2	Review	110
I also wondered whether the MCTS policy described in Equation 1 performs better than simply sampling from the policy network output.	I-Review	I-2	Review	110

 [line_break_token]In short, we represent molecules as Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP4), which are fed into a Highway Network with 5 layers and ELU nonlinearities.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	110
Due to the restricted space in the extended abstract, referred to our previous publication, which already describes the full details about the training data, molecular descriptors, the policy networks, and their architectures [Segler, Waller, Chem.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
Eur.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
J, (2017) DOI: 10.1002/chem.201605499] We have clarified this in the manuscript.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]You are right about chemical reaction data, they are indeed hard to come by.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
There is unfortunately no ‚Äúreaction MNIST‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
The reaction dataset we use stems from the Reaxys database, which is one of the most widely used databases by practicing organic chemists.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
The statement that it contains ‚Äúthe complete published knowledge of chemistry‚Äù may seem bold if one considers the huge challenge of constructing common sense knowledge bases, e.g. for natural language understanding.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
However, organic chemical reactions are a narrow domain and straightforward to represent computationally as graph transformations.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
There are only a few million reactions published in the chemical literature.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
Therefore, it is actually feasible to construct a knowledge base that covers almost every reaction ever published.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
Nevertheless, we have removed the statement from the text to avoid confusion.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The best moves for a particular molecule are the reported reactions that have been used to make it.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
This is completely analogous to AlphaGo, where, given a board position, the actually played moves are predicted to the best.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
It is possible to have different winning moves/reactions for the same position/molecule both for Go and for us.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
This is possibly one reason why neither AlphaGo nor our system reaches a very high accuracy.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]The improvement of MCTS is more a philosophical one, as it allows estimating the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of a molecule, which is its synthesizability (not all reasonable looking molecules can be made, which is a huge problem for computer aided drug design).	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	110
BFS by definition finds only one solution, and then stops.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110
MCTS on the other hand usually finds several solutions, and will backpropagate rewards from different branches to lower game tree nodes.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110
Even though MCTS eventually converges to one optimal branch, it is desirable to find not just one, but several alternative and robust routes, and MCTS more readily allows for that.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Is MCTS is thus less useful for retrosynthesis than in Go?	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110
To some degree yes!	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110
Empirically, we found that BFS is usually on par with MCTS on smaller, ‚Äúeasier‚Äù molecules, while MCTS usually finds better solutions for larger molecules (and thus larger search trees), where BFS sometimes struggles.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110
We are currently investigating this in detail for the full paper.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110
We would say what‚Äôs most useful about our findings is that the DNN policy (or DNN cost function for BFS) outperforms the hand-annotated heuristics regardless of the search method used.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]BFS is faster because it does less calculation, due to the lack of the rollout phase.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110
This is also what (probably) makes MCTS stronger.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110
The two main bottlenecks in our system is the neural network and the application of the transformations, the tree search itself is much faster than these two steps.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110
Restricting wall-clock time and simply sampling from the policy network are indeed interesting experiments, which we will carry out for the full paper.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110

The papers empirically studies the leakage propagation in TD learning, which is the problem of propagation of error through the state space caused by the bootstrapping of TD.	O	O	Review	110
[line_break_token]It suggests that the use of proper state space embedding might alleviate this problem.	O	O	Review	110
If two states are nearby in the input representation, but are far according to the dynamics of the MDP (that is, it takes many steps to reach from one state to another), the paper then suggests that the embedding should map them to two afar points.	O	O	Review	110
[line_break_token]The paper considers three embeddings, one of them manually designed and two others learned by an unsupervised signal, and shows that they reduce the leakage propagation problem.	O	O	Review	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper addresses an important problem, but I believe this work requires more study and deliberation (understanding that this is a workshop paper).	O	O	Review	110
Currently I cannot be very enthusiastic about this paper.	O	O	Review	110
For example, some of the shortcomings of this work are:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The paper is not clear about the choices of embedding.	B-Review	B-1	Review	110
What is the hand-crafted transformation, and what exactly is the rubber band loss?	I-Review	I-1	Review	110
It is desirable to be more formal here.	I-Review	I-1	Review	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Much of the intuition of this work is related to the porto-value functions and the eigenfunctions of Laplace-Beltrami operator, but the paper is only cursorily mention that (Mahadevan, 2005) did not use neural embedding to achieve so.	O	O	Review	110
Even so that is the case, the relation deserves much better comparison and acknowledgement.	O	O	Review	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- It is stated in Section 1.1 that the detailed setup is given in Appendix A, but that appendix only has a figure.	B-Review	B-2	Review	110
What is the dynamics of the movement?	I-Review	I-2	Review	110
Is it stochastic or deterministic?	I-Review	I-2	Review	110

[line_break_token]We acknowledge that, unfortunately, in the process of reducing our draft to fit the 3 pages limit for the workshop, we ended up removing too much detail about the different embeddings (notably the rubber band loss and the hand-crafted transformation), as well as the detailed descriptions of the environments.

We will naturally address those with an extended version of the paper, which can then also contain deeper comparisons with related work (notably proto-value functions, which indeed was only superficially mentioned).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Note: the environment is deterministic.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	110
It accepts every step from the agent, as long as it does not collide against a wall.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110
The policy we used is stochastic, though (it picks a random direction to move towards, at each point in time)	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	110

The paper considers the idea of projecting samples from an RL task into an intermediate representation before performing TD learning with a neural network.	O	O	Review	110
 It is demonstrated that the quality of learned value functions depends in part upon this representation, as error propagates along states that are nearby in the chosen representation.	O	O	Review	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]It is well-known and -researched that representation and feature selection is an important step in RL.	O	O	Review	110
 A great deal of prior work is ignored, to the extent that a list would be unwieldy.	B-Review	B-1	Review	110

At the moment we can quantitatively measure the MSVE of the value function estimation, but we can not exactly pinpoint what fraction of that error comes from the leakage propagation, and what fraction comes from other factors (limited capacity of network, issues in the optimization process, etc.).

The closest we got to that was to first train with MC and then continue training with TD.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110

[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper appears to be technically sound, but it should be rejected based on 1) the relatively limited applicability of the model and 2) a lack of thorough experimentation indicating that this is an appropriate method under more general circumstances.	B-Review	B-5	Review	110
It is odd that the model assumes the outcomes are measured without error.	B-Review	B-6	Review	110
Instead, it is assumed that the causes are measured with error, and mixed via F. A more appropriate model may be: Y=(XE+N)F+M, where an additional noise term M allows for Y to be measured imprecisely.	I-Review	I-6	Review	110
Viewed in this light, the model starts to look a lot like canonical correlation analysis.	I-Review	I-6	Review	110
Consider a model Y=ZF+M, X=ZG+N, if dim(Z) = dim(X) and G is invertible, this can be re-written as Y=(X inv(G)-N)A+M, and we arrive at a similar model with specific restrictions about the structure of inv(G) (E will in general not be invertible, so they are not the same).	I-Review	I-6	Review	110
It is particularly odd, then, that the authors do no comparisons against any regularized form of CCA, which would seem to be the most natural method to use in this circumstance.	B-Review	B-1	Review	110
Moreover, in the simulations where they show B2B outperforms CCA, they use 1000 training samples with 10-100 possible causes.	I-Review	I-1	Review	110
In their experiments on real data, where it seems the CCA results are much closer to the results that B2B gives, they have 2700 samples and 4 possible causes.	B-Review	B-2	Review	110
This seems to imply the real data case might be better conditioned than the simulated case, so that regularization would have less of an impact.	I-Review	I-2	Review	110
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In conclusion, the authors present a sound method for disentangling correlated possible causes when the outcome is high-dimensional.	B-Review	B-3	Review	110
However, the authors do not provide enough evidence that this method is generally useful and better than established methods to merit acceptance to ICLR.	I-Review	I-3	Review	110
A comparison to regularized CCA, application to more datasets and simulations under violations of the model would greatly improve the paper.	I-Review	I-3	Review	110
I also have two minor points.	I-Review	I-3	Review	110
1) the word ‚Äúcausal‚Äù can mean many things, and here it refers specifically to disentangling correlated predictors, rather than confounding in observations or direction of effect.	I-Review	I-3	Review	110
It would improve the paper to add some discussion of this point.	I-Review	I-3	Review	110
2) The comparisons in the experiments are done between E estimated from B2B and E=sum_j H_j^2 for other methods that do not directly estimate E. However, a more natural comparison might be against EF as this also includes estimates of the strength of influence of each observation, which is implicit in the sum above.	B-Review	B-4	Review	110

Overall, our updated results do not change the conclusion of our paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	110

 What we propose is somewhat different from this prior work.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1

 Both SNN-MIMIC models (8k and 400k) are trained to mimic the ECNN.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
 We mimic an ensemble of CNNs because we don‚Äôt have any unlabeled data for TIMIT and thus must use the modest-sized train set for compression.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
 With only 1.1M points available for compression, we observe that the student MIMIC model is usually 2-3% less accurate than the teacher model.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
 We also observe, however, that whenever we make the teacher model more accurate, the student MIMIC model gains a similar amount of accuracy as well (suggesting that the fixed gap between the deep teacher and shallow MIMIC models is due to a lack of unlabeled data, not a limited representational power in the shallow models).	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
 Because our goal is to train a shallow model of high accuracy, we needed to use a teacher model of maximum accuracy to help overcome this gap between the teacher and mimic not.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
 If we had a large unlabeled data set for TIMIT this would not be necessary.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
 The ensemble of CNNs is significantly more accurate than a single CNN, but we have not yet published that result.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
 We modified the paper to make all of this clearer	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1

An interesting workshop paper.	O	O	Review	1
For such a provocative title, more results are needed to support the conclusions.	B-Review	B-1	Review	1
Part of the resurgent success of neural networks for acoustic modeling is due to making the networks ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù with many hidden layers (see F. Seide, G. Li, and D. Yu, 'Conversational Speech Transcription Using Context-Dependent Deep Neural Networks', ICASSP 2011 which shows that shallow networks perform worse than deep for the same # of parameters).	B-Review	B-2	Review	1
This paper provides a different data point where a shallow network is trained using the author‚Äôs ‚ÄúMIMIC‚Äù technique performs as well as a deep network baseline on the TIMIT phone recognition task.	O	O	Review	1
The MIMIC technique involves using unsupervised soft labels from an ensemble of deep nets of unknown size and quality, including a linear layer of unknown size, and training on the un-normalized log prob rather than softmax output.	O	O	Review	1
The impact of each of these aspects on their own is not investigated; perhaps a deep neural network would gain from some or all of these MIMIC training steps as well.	B-Review	B-3	Review	1
Thank you for the comments.	O	O	Reply	1
 We completely agree that more results are needed to support the conclusions, and this is why we submitted an extended abstract instead of full paper.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	1
 More experiments are underway, but we don't yet have final results to add to the abstract.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1
 Preliminary results suggest that on TIMIT the MIMIC models are not as accurate as the teacher models mainly because we do not have enough unlabeled TIMIT data to capture the function of the teacher models, as opposed to because the MIMIC models have too little capacity or cannot learn a complex function in one layer.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1
 Preliminary results also suggest that: 1) the key to making the shallow MIMIC model more accurate is to train it to be more similar to the deep teacher net, and 2) the MIMIC model is better able to learn to mimic the teacher model when trained on logit (the unnormalized log probabilities) than on the softmax outputs from the teacher net.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1
 The only reason for including the linear layer between the input and non-linear hidden layer is to make training of the shallow model faster, not to increase accuracy.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1
 Experiments suggest that for TIMIT there is little benefit from using more than 250 linear units.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree with papers such as Seide, Li, and Yu, that shallow nets perform worse than deep nets given the same # of parameters when trained with the current training algorithms.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	1
 It is possible that, as Yoshua Bengio suggests, deep models provide a better prior than shallow models for complex learning problems.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1
It is also possible that other training algorithms and regularization methods would allow  shallow models to work as well.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1
  Or it may be a mix of the two.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1
 We believe the question of whether models must be deep to achieve extra accuracy is as yet open, and our experiments on TIMIT provide one data point that suggests it *might* be possible to train shallow models that are as accurate as deeper models on these problems.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We have tried using some of the MIMIC techniques to improve the accuracy of deep models.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	1
 With the MIMIC techniques we have been able to train deep models with fewer parameters that are as accurate as deep models with more parameters (i.e., reduce the number of weights and number of layers needed in the deep models), but we have not been able to achieve significant increases in accuracy for the deep models.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	1
 If compression is done well, the mimic model will be as accurate as the teacher model, but usually not more accurate, because the MIMIC process tries to duplicate the function (I/O behavior) learned by the teacher model in the smaller student model	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	1

This paper asks interesting questions and has interesting experimental results.	O	O	Review	1
The generality of the results could be improved by considering more than one dataset, though.	B-Review	B-1	Review	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]You might want to first fix a typo in Rich's name...[line_break_token][line_break_token]I concur with David Krueger regarding the somewhat misleading statements in the abstract and introduction etc regarding the matching of depth with width (and a LOT more training examples), which does not apply in the case of a convolutional net.	B-Review	B-2	Review	1
This really needs to be fixed.	B-Review	B-3	Review	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My take on the results is however quite different from the conclusions given in the paper.	B-Review	B-4	Review	1
The paper makes it sound as if we could find a better way to train shallow nets in order to get results as good as deep nets, as if it was just an optimization issue.	I-Review	I-4	Review	1
My interpretation is quite different.	I-Review	I-4	Review	1
The results seem more consistent with the interpretation that the depth (and convolutions) provide a PRIOR that helps GENERALIZING better.	I-Review	I-4	Review	1
This is consistent with the fact that a much wider network is necessary in the convolutional case, and that in both cases you need to complement the shallow net's training set with the fake/mimic examples (derived from observing the outputs of the deep net on unlabeled examples) in order to match the performance of a deep net.	I-Review	I-4	Review	1
I believe that my hypothesis could be disentangled from the one stated in the paper (which seems to say that it is a training or optimization issue) by looking at training error.	I-Review	I-4	Review	1
According to my hypothesis, the shallow net's training error (without the added fake / mimic examples) should not be significantly worse than that of the deep net (at comparable number of parameters).	I-Review	I-4	Review	1
According to the 'training' hypothesis that the authors seem to state, one would expect training error to be measurably lower for deep nets.	I-Review	I-4	Review	1
In fact, for other reasons I would expect the deep net's training error to be worse (this would be consistent with previous results, starting with my paper with Dumitru Erhan et al in JMLR in 2010).	I-Review	I-4	Review	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]It would be great to report those training errors.	B-Review	B-5	Review	1
Note that to be fair, you have to report training error with no early stopping, continuing training for a fixed and large number of epochs (the same in both cases) with the best learning rate you could find (separately for each type of network).	I-Review	I-5	Review	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally, the fact that even shallow nets (especially wide ones) can be hard to train (see Yann Dauphin's ICLR 2013 workshop-track paper) also weakens the hope that we could get around the difficulty of training deep nets by better training shallow nets.	B-Review	B-6	Review	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Several more papers need to be cited and discussed.	B-Review	B-7	Review	1
Besides my JMLR 2010 paper with Dumitru Erhan et al (Why Does Unsupervised Pre-training Help Deep Learning), another good datapoint regarding the questions raised here is the paper on Understanding Deep Architectures using a Recursive Convolutional Network, by Eigen, Rolfe & LeCun, submitted to this ICLR 2014 conference.	O	O	Review	1
Whereas my JMLR paper is about understanding the advantages of depth as a regularizer, this more recent paper tries to tease apart various architectural factors (including depth) influencing performance, especially for convolutional nets.	B-Review	B-7	Review	1
Yoshua, thank you for your comments.	O	O	Reply	1
 We believe you may have read an older draft and hope that most or all of the misleading statements were corrected in the Jan 3 draft.	O	O	Reply	1
 Nonetheless, many of your comments still apply to the current paper.	O	O	Reply	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We completely agree that generality would be improved with results on additional datasets.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	1
 We submitted a workshop abstract instead of full paper because we only had results for one data set, and are about to run experiments on two other datasets.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]With TIMIT we did not use more training data to train the shallow models than was used to train the deep models.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	1
 We used exactly the same 1.1M training cases used to train the DNN and CNN models to train the SNN mimic model.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
 The only difference is that the mimic SNN does not see the original labels.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
 Instead, it sees the real-valued probabilities predicted by the DNN or CNN it is trying to mimic.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
 In general, model compression works best when a large unlabelled data set is available to be labeled by the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù model so that the smaller mimic model can be trained ‚Äúhard‚Äù with less chance of overfitting.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
 But for TIMIT unlabelled data was not available so we used the same data used to train the deep models for compression (mimic) training.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
 We believe that the fact that no extra data --- labeled or unlabelled --- was used to train the SNN models helps drive home the point that it may be possible to train shallow models to be as accurate as deep models.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree with your comment that ‚ÄúThe paper makes it sound as if we could find a better way to train shallow nets in order to get results as good as deep nets, as if it was just an optimization issue.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	1
‚Äù, except that we view it more perhaps as an issue of regularization than of just optimization.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1
 In particular, we agree that depth, when combined with current learning and regularization methods such as dropout, is providing a prior that aids generalization, but are not sure that a similar effect could not be achieved using a different learning algorithm and regularization scheme to train a shallow net on the original data.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1
 In some sense we‚Äôre making a black-box argument: we already have a procedure that given a training set, yields a shallow net that has accuracy comparable to a deep fully-connected feedforward net trained on the same data.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1
 If we hadn‚Äôt shown you what the learning algorithm was in our black box would you have been 100% sure that the wizard behind the curtain must have been deep learning?	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1
The real question is whether the black box *must* go through the intermediate step of training a deep model to mimic, or whether there exist other learning and regularization procedures that could achieve the same result without going through the deep intermediary.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1
 We do not (yet) know the answer to this question, but it is interesting that a shallow model can be trained that is as accurate as a deep model without access to any additional data.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1
 We certainly agree that it is difficult to train large, shallow nets on the original targets with the learning procedures currently available.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree that looking at training errors can be informative, but they might not resolve the issue in this case.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	1
 If model compression has access to a very large unlabelled data set, if the mimic model has sufficient capacity to represent the deep model, the shallow model will learn to be a high-fidelity mimic of the deep model and will make the same predictions, and the error of the shallow mimic model and deep model on train and test data will be identical as the error of the mimic predictions compared to the deep model is driven to zero.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	1
 This is for the ideal case where we have access to a very large unlabelled data set, which unfortunately we did not have for TIMIT.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	1
 Exactly what training errors do you want to see: the error of the DNN on the original training data vs. the error of the SNN trained to mimic the DNN on the real-valued targets, but measured on the original labels of the training points, or vs. the error of an SNN trained on the original data and labels?	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	1
 Early stopping was used when training the deep models, but was not used when training the mimic SNN models.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	1
 In fact we find it very difficult to make the SNN mimic model overfit when trained with L2 loss on continuous targets.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	1
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Thanks for the pointers to other papers we should have cited.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	1

 We submitted a revised draft on Jan 3 that addressed some of your concerns.	O	O	Reply	1
 We‚Äôre sorry you read the earlier, rougher draft.	O	O	Reply	1
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]You are correct that we are not able to train a shallow net to mimic the CNN model using a similar number of parameters as the CNN model, and the text has been edited to reflect this.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	1
 We believe that if we had a large (> 100M) unlabelled data set drawn from the same distribution as TIMIT that we would be able to train a shallow model with less than ~15X as many parameters to mimic the CNN with high fidelity, but are unable to test that hypothesis on TIMIT and are now starting experiments on another problem where we will have access to virtually unlimited unlabelled data.	O	O	Reply	1
But we agree that the number of parameters in the shallow model will not be as small as the number of parameters in the CNN because the weight sharing of the local receptive fields in the CNN allows it to accomplish more with a small number of weights than can be accomplished with one fully-connected hidden layer.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	1
 Note that the primary argument in the paper, that it is possible to train a shallow neural net (SNN) to be as accurate as a deeper, fully-connected feedforward net (DNN), does not depend on being able to train an SNN to mimic a CNN with the same number of parameters as the CNN.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	1
 We view the fact that a large SNN can mimic the CNN without the benefit of the convolutional architecture as an interesting, but secondary issue.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	1

The authors propose an adaptive loss scaling method during the backpropagation stage for the mix precision training to reduce the underflow.	O	O	Review	20615
Compared with the previous work, which scales the loss by human design, and needs to be consistent in all layers.	O	O	Review	20615
The authors state that they can decide the scale rate layer by layer automatically to reduce the underflow in a low precision situation.	O	O	Review	20615
[line_break_token][line_break_token]They calculate the scale rate using the statistic information of the layer weight and gradient.	O	O	Review	20615
By adaptively scale each layer‚Äôs loss and gradient, this method can reduce the underflow rate better than the previous work.	O	O	Review	20615
Additionally, the authors claim that the computation overhead is not significant, so it is efficient to use rather than searching from a set of fix scale rates.&nbsp;[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experiments present on image classification and objective detection benchmarks.	O	O	Review	20615
From the result, we can see that the adaptive loss scale reaches a relatively high point on all the tasks.	O	O	Review	20615
[line_break_token]‚Ä®[line_break_token]Pros:[line_break_token]‚Ä®[line_break_token]- The method is straight forward and easy to understand.	O	O	Review	20615
The motivation is good.	O	O	Review	20615
They get some impressive results on ResNet110 and SSD512 comparing with the fixed scaling method.	O	O	Review	20615
Besides, they give some analysis of their advantages and disadvantages in different networks, which looks promising to me.	O	O	Review	20615
[line_break_token]‚Ä®[line_break_token]Cons:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- One question in Section 3.2.1, the assumption that w, g, p can be treated as the random variable with Gaussian distribution seems not natural in the training process.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20615
Especially p is a zero-mean distribution.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20615
The cited paper uses this assumption in a more convincing case, such as the weight initialization task.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20615
Notice that He et al 2015 claim that the product of weight and gradient can be a zero-mean normal distribution is based on the weight is a symmetric distribution around zero, which is not true in neither this paper‚Äôs assumption nor the real training situation.&nbsp;[line_break_token][line_break_token]- In the objective detection part, I can not find which dataset the authors use.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20615
Though the author state that they follow Liu et al 2016 ‚Äôs work, there are also several tasks in Liu‚Äôs paper, and I can not directly match the resulting point with any of those tasks, which makes me hard to confirm the experiment result.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20615
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The experiment setting is unclear.	O	O	Review	20615
Here are two questions.	O	O	Review	20615
1, What is the initial scale at the last layer?	B-Review	B-3	Review	20615
It should be manually designed in the experiment, and I think this value may affect the other layer‚Äôs scale as well.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20615
If the algorithm is robust for this scale, it is better to show some study on that.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20615
2, What update frequency is used in the experiment?	B-Review	B-4	Review	20615
The authors say that the overhead can be reduced by reducing the frequency, but they do not clearly show which frequency they use in their experiment, if the frequency does not affect the performance, it is also better to claim or show some study on that.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20615
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor comments:[line_break_token]- Figures can use a larger font.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20615

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q1:[line_break_token]This is a valuable comment.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20615
We do understand that this assumption on distribution may cause some confusion points, and we don‚Äôt have enough space to explain them in detail in the paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20615
Here we elaborate more on this topic.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20615
[line_break_token]First of all, regarding the source of this assumption: the assumption on the product term to be with normal distribution is not just from [1], [2] also establishes their theoretical framework on this assumption and achieves good empirical evaluation results, which provides another source of confidence for using this assumption.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20615
[line_break_token]Next, it is true that a statistical property that holds in the initialization phase may not still hold during the training procedure.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20615
But we haven‚Äôt found any existing paper that can model tightly how the data distribution may change during training, and we unfortunately don‚Äôt have the required mathematical background to achieve that goal either.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20615
Therefore, in this paper, we conservatively argue that, if the assumption holds, our calculated loss scale can perfectly achieve the desired underflow rate; and if not, we may exceedingly or not effectively reduce the underflow rate, but overflow is guaranteed not to happen (Section 3.2.3).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20615
[line_break_token]Last but not least, we make some empirical discoveries on this assumption.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20615
We run ResNet-18 training on ImageNet for several iterations, and we collect the product term from different layers at some iterations and plot their distribution (Fig 2.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20615

It shows that for most layers, the distribution of the actual data looks similar to the modelled normal distribution.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20615
Also, as shown in the subtitle of each figure, these actual data are quite close to zero mean.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20615
Indeed, there are biases in real-world data from the assumption, but since these biases are moderate (e.g., not a completely different distribution), and our implementation can permit these biases, the usability of our approach won‚Äôt be affected much.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20615

Update frequency is, as far as we've empirically confirmed, neutral to accuracy.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20615

The paper considers the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) sample detection while solving a classification task.	O	O	Review	20703
The authors tackle the problem of OOD detection with exploiting uncertainty while passing a test sample through the neural network.	O	O	Review	20703
They treat outputs of (some) layers in a NN as random Gaussian-distributed variables and measure uncertainty as variance of these Gaussians.	O	O	Review	20703
Then when uncertainty is high, OOD is detected.	O	O	Review	20703
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The overall idea behind the paper could be interesting, but its realisation in the current form is questionable.	O	O	Review	20703
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper seems totally misusing the reparametrisation trick and stochastic outputs of layers in NNs.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20703
Eq. (	I-Review	I-1	Review	20703
2) is not the objective of variational inference that seems to be required for stochastic outputs and the reparametrisation trick as presented before the equation.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20703
The objective misses the KL-divergence term!	I-Review	I-1	Review	20703
Without it what would stop a neural net to set sigmas to 0 and forget about the stochasticity altogether?	I-Review	I-1	Review	20703
Not to mention that the current objective is not mathematically justified.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20703
[line_break_token]If there is no mix and error in eq. (	I-Review	I-1	Review	20703
2) and the networks were trained using this loss (and based on provided code they were using this loss), my wild guess of explaining why this may give best results in the experiments is that the models were trained for surprisingly small number of epochs.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20703
Therefore, a hypothesis would be that this small number of epochs did not allow the networks to switch sigmas to 0.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20703
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Until the authors can clarify and justify the objective, I will vote for rejection only based on this ground.	O	O	Review	20703
[line_break_token][line_break_token]However, there are other issues in the paper as well.	O	O	Review	20703
First of all, its clarity.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20703
It seems that the paper requires a lot of polishing.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20703
 The first paragraph of this review is based on my assumptions from the paper since I am not completely sure I understand it correctly.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20703
More about the clarity issues below[line_break_token][line_break_token]For strong evaluation, comparison with Malinin &amp; Gales (2018) work seems to be important since it was the only work also using uncertainties for OOD detection in related work.	O	O	Review	20703
Also related work section does not look like an exhaustive overview.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20703
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Some of the detailed comments:[line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	20703
[tab_token]‚ÄúIn other words, in-distribution samples possess more features that convolutional filters react to than OOD samples‚Äù ‚Äì first of all, this sentence is not easy to parse.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20703
Secondly, it is unclear, why this should be true.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20703
If OOD samples are still natural images, they would contain edges just the same as in-distribution samples.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20703
That is the power of deep learning enabling transfer learning, that low-level features are the transferable across different data and tasks.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20703
Therefore, the claim that ‚ÄúTherefore, the uncertainties of the features will be larger when the inputs are in-distribution samples‚Äù requires more elaboration and arguments[line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	20703
[tab_token]The arguments of the next paragraph regarding uncertainty of deeper layers should be larger for OOD samples are not very convincing either.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20703
 It is either requires a definition what the authors mean here as uncertainty, or it is not necessarily true that absence of fixed regions for embeddings leads to higher uncertainty.	I-Review	I-5	Review	20703
[line_break_token]3.	O	O	Review	20703

The issue of estimating uncertainty is addressed by several special methods such as Bayesian variational methods used in the referred papers.	I-Review	I-8	Review	20703

[line_break_token][line_break_token]We do this because we would like to use the data uncertainty of the intermediate layer and the last layer by using reparameterization, as in VIB [Alemi, 2016].

This result shows that the sum of each variance is a feature that can discriminate between OOD and in-distribution inputs.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20703

This paper tackles out-of-distribution samples detection via training VAE-like networks.	O	O	Review	20703
The key idea is to inject learnable Gaussian noise to each layer across the network in the hope that the variance of the noise correlates well with the uncertainty of the input features.	O	O	Review	20703
The network is trained to minimize the empirical loss subject to noise perturbation.	O	O	Review	20703
The paper is well written, and the background is introduced clearly.	O	O	Review	20703
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]As I understand it, the goal of *out-of-distribution sample detection* is to train a deep network that simultaneously generalizes well and also be discriminative to outliers.	O	O	Review	20703
However, it‚Äôs not clear to me why the proposed method server this purpose; empirical results are not convincing either.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20703
My major concerns are as follows:[line_break_token] [line_break_token]First of all, from my intuition, it would be much easier to train deterministic networks than their counterparts with randomness.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20703
Empirically, researchers also often observe near-zero training loss for large deterministic networks such as Dense-BC trained on simple CIFAR/SVHN datasets.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20703
Especially, in this case, the training goal is simply to map higher-dimensional inputs to lower-dimensional classification categories.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20703
That being said, one would expect the variances go to zero at convergence to achieve lower empirical loss in the case of no additional diversity (or uncertainty) promotion terms.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20703
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]It is not clear to me how to avoid degenerate solutions at convergence [line_break_token]while maintaining good testing performance with the proposed training strategy.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20703
[line_break_token]From the empirical results, it also appears that all models reported might not be fully optimized?	B-Review	B-4	Review	20703
[line_break_token]The baseline results are significantly worse than those reported in previous work.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20703
 [line_break_token]Specifically, [line_break_token]in table 1, the testing accuracy of Dense-BC trained on CIFAR-100 is only 71.6.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20703
[line_break_token]In table 2, the reported testing accuracy on CIFAR-10 using Dense-BC is 92.4.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20703
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]However, the results of DenseNet-BC (k=12, L=100, table 2) reported in the original paper are:[line_break_token]CIFAR10  94.0  (also leave 5K examples as validation set)[line_break_token]CIFAR100 75.9[line_break_token]  [line_break_token]Meanwhile, the reported accuracy of WRN-40-4 trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are 89.6 and 66.0, respectively.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20703
However, the corresponding baseline numbers in the original WRN paper are much higher,  [line_break_token]CIFAR-10  95.03[line_break_token]CIFAR-100 77.11 [line_break_token][line_break_token]Could the authors comment on that?	I-Review	I-4	Review	20703

Summary:[line_break_token]      This paper discussed an approach to do named entity resolution (NER, the paper focuses only on Chinese NER but I think it could generalize to other languages as well).	O	O	Review	20669
The idea is based on smart integration and extension of multiple existing building blocks: 1) BERT pre-trained model 2) a previous work to get document embedding by doing weighted average of word embedding (<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyK00v5xx)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyK00v5xx)</a> and 3) Scaled dot-product attention mechanism applied directly to multi-label classification.

The "Introduction", "Related work", and "Experiment Settings" sections are well written and covers many details and decent references.	O	O	Review	20669
Especially, the "experiments" section is described in a great amount of details, which should be very helpful for reproducibility.	O	O	Review	20669
[line_break_token]      [line_break_token]Contributions:[line_break_token]      * The author found an interesting application of the original algorithm (<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyK00v5xx)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyK00v5xx)</a> to represent the entity class embedding based on averaging "BERT" embeddings of all the component words.	O	O	Review	20669
This could be implemented as a pre-processing step against any training dataset to derive "pre-learned" entity class embedding.	O	O	Review	20669
[line_break_token]      * Instead of the common approach of connecting the BERT sequence outputs directly to CRF layer, the author added an intermediate layer to calculate the classification attention between a sentence (sequence of token embedding) and any entity class (based on the above pre-learned entity embedding).

This result plus the original sentence embedding are concatenated.	O	O	Review	20669
 The concatenation is further fed into a few additional layers to produce the final inputs into CRF layer.	O	O	Review	20669

[line_break_token]     In the paper„ÄäJoint Embedding of Words and Labels for Text Classification„Äã, the label embeddings are trained together with the model, hoping to obtain a class template that could highlight related words with the particular text Topic .For instance, in Figure4(a),it highlights ‚Äúcoaches‚Äù„ÄÅ‚Äùsports‚Äù for STORT news and ‚Äúrock‚Äù, ‚Äúdrummer‚Äù for Entertainment news.

However, if the predefined entity class in our method is only PERSON, entities in the remaining categories will not be highlighted under ideal conditions[line_break_token]      In my opinion, our approach has a more dominant effect on the NER field, or in areas with a defined reading goal, because the class embedding for attention is preset to the entity class that you want to extract.

 One possible objection to inclusion of active neurons is that their contributions are accounted in the switched projection, whereas the impact of the switched off neuron terminates at that neuron.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	554
 There is a potential for more generic future methods based on \hat{w}-\hat{c}, but we feel that pointing out the significance of the "off" neurons is a important contribution that would be of interest to many readers, who later on may go on to use this approach in different and perhaps even improved ways.

This manuscript introduces a novel method to explain activities of ReLU-based deep networks by constructing a linear subnetwork which only contains neurons activated by the input.	O	O	Review	554
The status of each neuron can be obtained given any input sample.	O	O	Review	554

The activity of each neuron can be decomposed into the attribution of each input pixel, and this decomposition can also be used to measure the contribution of each pixel to the network stability.	O	O	Review	554

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Indeed, Insens in not model agnostic, but the driving idea of this work is that inactive neurons carry information about what is happening inside the network.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	554
 For non-ReLU networks there is no notion of inactive neurons as it would be hard to find, in a sigmoid network for instance, a neuron outputting exactly zero.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
The non-linearity at exactly 0 is a unique feature of ReLU networks that allows separation of the architecture into active and inactive sub-networks - a feature that can be exploited for the analysis presented in the paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
 In fact, the switched linear projection itself is generalisable to networks with non-ReLU functions - we hint at this in the paper when we state that switched projection is equivalent to derivative of activity with respect to the input.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
 So, \hat{w}=dv/dx, and therefore \hat{b}=v-\hat{w}x, which can be computed for a neuron from a network of any activation function (as long as the function has a first derivative).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
 However, since we were specifically interested in the notion of separating the non-active subnetwork from the rest of the architecture, we decided, in the interest of readability, to limit the paper to ReLU networks only.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
 We believe that this is still a worthy and useful contribution on the account of prevalence of the ReLU networks in deep learning applications.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554

The visualisations from the penultimate layer are still of decent quality, but now definitely not simply echoing the input.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	554
 At the same time, we can use the new layered definition to track the inactive state through different layers of the network.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	554
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree that more experiments on a broader set of input data is always a great idea, but the space is limited, and we felt that image-based visualisation are sufficient to present our novel method.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	554
 However, as the reviewer suggested, we did add visualisations for adversarial examples in the appendix.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	554
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In Figure 4, where the noisy digit gets misclassified, indeed the visualisation does not necessarily produce an image of the wrong digit.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	554
 But this assumes that the only way for a network to misclassify a digit is to mistake it for another one.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	554
 It's important to keep in mind that, given softmax output, the network divides the space of all images into digits.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	554
 As a result, there are many images that have nothing to do with numbers, yet the network will classify as one of the digits.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	554
 Thus, as in the case of the adversarial examples included in the appendix, the network does not necessarily "see" the wrong digit when making the wrong prediction.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	554
 Instead, it sees the noise that happens to produce a particular label.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	554
 We believe Insens visualisations highlight that noise, but it's hard for us to see patterns in it, since the network is not reacting to a shape-based pattern.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	554

The work basically introduced a new way of looking at interpretability; instead of focusing on the source of activations in the network for a given input image, focus on the source of stability (non-active) neurons (in a ReLU network).	O	O	Review	554
The work starts by proving (although it is trivial) that in a ReLU (more generally any piece-wise linear) network, for a given input image, there is a locally linear relationship between a given neuron's activation and the image: v= w^T x + b. As the authors correctly mention, focusing on 'w' as the sensitivity analysis is basically the vanilla gradient method.	O	O	Review	554
The contribution, however, is focusing on the projection of bias and the introduced notion of 'centre'.	O	O	Review	554
With this provided notion, one can focus on the deactivated neurons in the network and how each input pixel is responsible for it.	O	O	Review	554
In other words, unlike previous work that focuses on the activation map, the authors correctly refer to the deactivated neurons as another source of the network's prediction.	O	O	Review	554
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I'm have reasons for both accepting and rejecting this work.	O	O	Review	554
 The work provides a new perspective and asks a very interesting question.	O	O	Review	554
The introduced method, although quite simple and trivial, is useful and the authors do a very good job of making valid and reasonable claims about their work's contribution and how it connects to the existing literature.	O	O	Review	554
The main drawback of the paper, however, is whether the contributions are enough for this venue.	B-Review	B-6	Review	554
The paper does not convince me that the introduced method would result in better interpretability of deep networks compared to what is already there.	I-Review	I-6	Review	554
Another minor (or for some people in the field major) issue is the experimental setup.	I-Review	I-6	Review	554
 All of the experiments are focused on subjective examples and no objective measure of the introduced method is provided (and the field has many of those objective measures).	I-Review	I-6	Review	554
Providing a few examples of the method in comparison with other methods is not sufficient.	I-Review	I-6	Review	554
Anyhow, the experiment where they prove the usefulness of the method by adding background noise is interesting.	I-Review	I-6	Review	554
I would personally suggest the authors to expand this experiment to testing the method's sanity using the sanity measures provided in previous work: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03292" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03292</a> The claims made about the results on smallNORB can be controversial as the authors interpret their method's flipping of importance to be the reality of what's happening in the network and the other method's focus on the edges as false; this is not clear to be true.	O	O	Review	554
My score would be subject to change if better experimental results are provided (and the other way round).	B-Review	B-6	Review	554
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A few suggestions and questions:[line_break_token]* One very important issue with the method is that it considers all of the inactive neurons.	B-Review	B-1	Review	554
We know that a substantial percentage of inactive neurons are just dead neurons the stability of which does not matter.	I-Review	I-1	Review	554
How would the method address the issue?	I-Review	I-1	Review	554
[line_break_token]* There definitely needs to be an objective measure of the introduced method's performance compared to previous work.	B-Review	B-2	Review	554
[line_break_token]* The work seems very related to DeepLIFT while there is no mentioning of it.	B-Review	B-3	Review	554
[line_break_token]* I'm not a fan, but adding results on a SOTA ImageNET paper always helps with making the experiments section crisper.	B-Review	B-4	Review	554
[line_break_token]* The authors claim that even small perturbations will change the activation pattern.	B-Review	B-5	Review	554
This is not a small claim and is definitely in need of more evidence.	I-Review	I-5	Review	554
hank you for very insightful review.	O	O	Reply	554
 The time taken to respond is a consequence of some soul searching and a decent amount of work we had to undergo in order to address the request for objective evaluation of the proposed method.	O	O	Reply	554
[line_break_token][line_break_token]After quick test based on Abedayo et al's objective measures of visualisation, it became immediately apparent that the correlation between Insens visualisations from the trained, random weights and random label networks, though lower than DeepTaylor's, is still quite high.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	554
 However, after an investigation, we realised that if we compute Insens over the inactive neurons of a given layer (rather than over the whole network), then these correlations vary from layer to layer.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
 While this required a slight change of definition of Insens,  visualisations based on the penultimate layer of the network were still very good.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
 This new definition also created the potential for visualisation of the inactive state layer by layer.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
 We feel that these changes do not detract from the main argument of the paper, which promotes the use of inactive state for interpretability.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
 Hence, we‚Äôve decided to change the evaluation a bit and add the saliency tests.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
 The new version of the paper has been uploaded.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
[line_break_token][line_break_token]With respect to completely dead neurons, initially we thought these could be simply taken out of the network before the Insens computation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
 But thinking about importance of the neurons that are off for most of the time (when tracking their activity over all training samples) as opposed to those that are inactive half of the time, we decided to supplement the Insens sum with a weighting factor.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
 The factor m_i/N multiplies the insensitivity vector by the ratio of the number of times the neuron in question is active (over the training data) , m_i, over the number of training examples, N.  For neurons that are always off m_i/N=0, for those that are almost always on, but inactive for a given input in Insens, m_i/N -&gt; 1.	O	O	Reply	554
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We have included an analogy to DeepLIFT‚Äôs reference input when explaining the concept of neuron‚Äôs centre.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	554
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The main reason why we can‚Äôt at this time include the state of the art ImageNET visualisations is because our computation of Insens is (at this moment) not very efficient.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	554
  In VGG-16, there are, on average, 50% inactive neurons for a given input - that‚Äôs many millions of inactive neurons.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	554
 The easiest way to compute a switched vector is to take the derivative of neuron activity with respect to the network input, and then find \hat{b} by subtracting \hat{w}x from v.  Since our implementation is in Tensorflow, it would seem easy, but Tensorflow creates separate graph for each derivative of activity with respect to the input.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	554
 While it does have a single operation for computing sum of derivatives, this would give us a sum of \hat{w}, whereas for Insens we need the sum of \hat{w}-\hat{c} (and we can't calculated these sums separately since \hat{c}=v\hat{w}/(\hat{w}^t\hat{w}) is not independent of \hat{w}).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	554
 It should be possible to add an operation to Tensorflow that does what we need in one graph, but at this point we don‚Äôt have the Tensorflow know-how on how to do this in such a short time.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	554
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In relation to our claim that even small perturbations will change the activation pattern, this is based on some sporadic experimental evidence, which is not ready for publication and quite possibly would qualify as a different paper altogether.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	554
 We removed this statement from our conclusion and toned down the claims of Insens being better than active-based visualisation.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	554
Nevertheless we feel that the idea of using inactive state for interpretability and Insens are still strong contributions that supplement existing methods for interpretability.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	554

Notes: [line_break_token][line_break_token]  -Goal is to study the "active subnetwork" of Relu based networks for interpretability.	O	O	Review	554
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]  -The question of interpretation seems rather thorny.	O	O	Review	554
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]  -In Figure 4, the result for Insens seem alright, although it's weird that the data is just mnist digit / noise.	B-Review	B-1	Review	554
 I feel like something with multiple objects would make it much clearer if there is an actual improvement?	I-Review	I-1	Review	554
 For example on Figure 5 I'm not really sure if Insens is better.	I-Review	I-1	Review	554
 The results often look worse to me than "DeepTaylor", especially on CIFAR10.	I-Review	I-1	Review	554
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]Review: This paper proposes to improve the interpretation of relu based networks by considering the "inactive network" which could potentially become activated by local perturbations instead of just considering the active part of the network (which is locally linear).	O	O	Review	554
 I think this is a step in the right direction for the interpretation of relu based networks, although the results are somewhat borderline.	O	O	Review	554
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]Additionally the tasks could be much better, to show situations where an object is present but which is not related to the labels.	B-Review	B-2	Review	554
 This would provide a much clearer test of the model's capabilities.	I-Review	I-2	Review	554

[line_break_token][line_break_token]As the reviewer pointed out, in the original paper the Insens visualisations were similar to DeepTaylor one, on occasion perhaps not being even equally good.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	554
 Prompted by another review, we carried out saliency and sensitivity analysis which show that both the original Insens and DeepTaylor produced similar visualisations for the same input regardless of the model it passed through.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
However, after redefining Insens to relate information of the inactive neuron sensitivity over individual layers of a network (in the latest edition of the paper), we created a method for layered interpretability, from the early stages where neurons "look at the entire input", to "decision making" patterns of the penultimate layer of the network.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	554
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The suggestion of evaluation over images with objects that need to be ignored is quite a nice idea.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	554
 When working on new experiments for the layered version of Insens, we did create a simple MNIST dataset with two different digits in the input image and one label.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	554
 In the first instance, the digit to be labeled was always on the left-hand side...in which case the task was trivial - the network easily learns to ignore the other side of the image, and the non-label digits are not highlighted in all visualisation methods (or are a bit fainter in case of DeepTaylor).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	554
 Then we tried a task where the each image contained randomly ordered even and odd number, with the even number labelled.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	554
 This network didn't train well over the 2CONV architecture (poor test accuracy).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	554
 The option of trying a bigger network is not appealing, since if the visualisation shows both digits as being important, it is not clear whether the visualisation is wrong.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	554
After all, it's probably possible for the network to "memorise" all combinations of possible digits (at least in this test) and thus show both as important.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	554
 Hence, we decided not to pursue this experiment any further, especially since at best it could only make it to the appendix of the paper.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	554

O	O	Reply	554
The most important difference between their algorithm and ours is that they train the supervised task on labeled data, and self-supervised task on unlabeled data, while we train the self-supervised task(s) simultaneously on both domains (labeled and unlabeled).	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	554
Conceptually, training the self-supervised task on both domains is critical for alignment, which is the main objective for adaptation.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	554
Because for semi-supervised learning, the labeled and unlabeled data come from the same domain, methods for semi-supervised learning e.g. S4L do not need to consider the alignment problem.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	554
These comments are not intended to criticize S4L, as it is solving a different problem.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	554
In fact, theoretical analysis for semi-supervised learning [Cohen, Cozman] [Ghifary et al] suggests that training the self-supervised task on both domains is not helpful for semi-supervised learning; it is interesting to see how this picture is different for domain adaptation.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	554

This paper presents a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework for neural networks.	O	O	Review	554
Similarly to existing approaches, it performs adaptation by aligning representations of the source and the target domains.	O	O	Review	554
The main difference is that this alignment is achieved not through explicitly minimizing some distribution discrepancy (this usually leads to challenging minimax optimization problems).	O	O	Review	554
Instead, the authors propose to use a battery of auxiliary self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks for both domains simultaneously.	O	O	Review	554
Each task is meant to align the source and the target representations along a direction of variation relevant to that task.	O	O	Review	554
Assuming that the battery is diverse enough, optimizing the representation for all the tasks leads to matching of the distributions.	O	O	Review	554
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros:[line_break_token]+ The paper is well-written and easy to read.	O	O	Review	554
[line_break_token]+ I like the simplicity of the idea and the fact that it achieves competitive performance without any adversarial learning (which may be very tricky to deal with).	O	O	Review	554
[line_break_token]+ The paper presents a reasonable procedure for hyper-parameter tuning and early stopping which seems to work well in practice.	O	O	Review	554
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons:[line_break_token]- The paper is purely practical with no theory backing the approach.	B-Review	B-1	Review	554
As a result, the discussion of guarantees and limitations is quite brief.	I-Review	I-1	Review	554
[line_break_token]- It‚Äôs unclear how easy it is to come up with a reasonable set of SSL tasks for a particular pair of domains.	B-Review	B-2	Review	554
It seems that it may become a serious problem when the method is applied to something other than benchmarks.	I-Review	I-2	Review	554
Table 2 reveals that there is no consistent improvement over the existing approaches which suggests that the chosen battery of SSL tasks is not universal (as the authors themselves admit).	I-Review	I-2	Review	554
On a related note, it‚Äôs a bit disappointing that the authors mention SVHN results as a failure case but never provide a way to address the issue.	I-Review	I-2	Review	554
[line_break_token]- It would be nice to some results for the Office dataset for completeness.	B-Review	B-3	Review	554
The authors could use a pre-trained network as a starting points just like it‚Äôs done in other papers.	I-Review	I-3	Review	554
According to the last paragraph of Section 6 this experiment should be feasible.	I-Review	I-3	Review	554

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, I think it‚Äôs a good paper presenting a thought-provoking idea.	O	O	Review	554
In my opinion, the weakest point of the work is the lack of any (neither principled nor practical) guidance as to how to choose the set of self-supervised tasks.	B-Review	B-2	Review	554

‚Äù We have in fact given some practical guidance in the paper, which we summarize below as two necessary conditions:[line_break_token]- The self-supervised task is well defined and nontrivial on both domains.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	554
This rules out the case of rotation prediction on SVHN, since as we explain in the paper, ‚Äúthe rotation head learns to look at the periphery and cheat‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	554
[line_break_token]- ‚ÄúThe labels created by self-supervision should not require capturing information on the very factors where the domains are meaninglessly different.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	554
‚Äù as said and explained in section 3.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	554
This is rules out tasks such as colorization and autoencoder, for which it is important to learn the low-level details of the image.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	554
[line_break_token]These two conditions are easy to reason about in practice.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	554
If the ‚Äúbattery of self-supervised tasks‚Äù satisfy them, there should be notable improvement on top of the source only baseline as we observe empirically, but there won‚Äôt be a guarantee.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	554
In addition, we would like this paper to add to the toolbox of available domain adaptation methods instead of becoming the only tool.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	554
When a good self-supervised task satisfying the two conditions cannot be found (SVHN), previous methods have provided different tools to use.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	554
When a good self-supervised task naturally exists, our method provides a simple and effective choice.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	554

## Summary[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors identify a synergy between the rate distortion (RD) and reinforcement learning (RL) literature.	O	O	Review	866
RD work shows how to optimise resources when capacity is limited and the authors transfer this idea to RL and posit a novel algorithm based on the Actor critic algorithm.	O	O	Review	866
In experiments this is shown to learn more quickly and transfer between similar tasks more easiliy than the conventional AC algorithm.	O	O	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This is a genuinely inciteful piece of work and may be of very significant interest to the community.	O	O	Review	866
Particuarly to those in transfer learning, heirarchical learning and other areas of RL where an adaptable rate limited policy is an advantage.	O	O	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experiments are limited to a single domain, and ideally this would be demonstrated across more than just those examples explored.	B-Review	B-1	Review	866
However, I think that the value of the theoretical advance, and the clarity/readability of the paper warrants acceptance.	O	O	Review	866
[line_break_token]Thank you for your review.	O	O	Reply	866
We agree that much of the strength of the current paper lies in introducing a relatively novel, and principled theoretical framework to a broad audience.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	866
We view this work as a jumping off point for readers who have some background in rate-distortion theory, or reinforcement learning.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	866
However, few in the machine learning community have more than passing knowledge of both.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	866
We feel the demonstration of the approach in a small-scale environment allows for an unhurried exposition of the theory and demonstration of its behavior.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	866
Many of the details of the algorithm can be substituted, for example utilizing deep-NNs for approximating an optimal-but-capacity-limited channel, enabling the extension to large or continuous state-spaces.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	866
Given the recommended page limits of the ICLR proceedings, we opted for a fuller and more accessible exposition of the theoretical approach, rather than an extensive demonstration of its empirical performance	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	866

(score raised from 6 to 7 after the rebuttal)[line_break_token]The paper explores the application of the rate-distortion framework to policy learning in the reinforcement learning setting.	O	O	Review	866
In particular, a policy that maps from states to actions is considered an information theoretic channel of limited capacity.	O	O	Review	866
This viewpoint provides an interesting angle which allows modeling/learning of (computationally) bounded-rational policies.	O	O	Review	866
While capacity-limitation might intuitively seem to be a disadvantage, intriguing arguments (based on solid theoretical foundations, rooted in first principles) can be made in favor of capacity-limited systems.	O	O	Review	866
Two of the main-arguments are that capacity-limited policies should be faster to learn and be more robust, i.e. generalize better.	O	O	Review	866
After thoroughly introducing these arguments on a less formal level and putting them into perspective with regard to reinforcement learning and related work in the literature, the paper demonstrates these properties in a toy grid-world example.	O	O	Review	866
When compared against a vanilla actor-critic (AC) algorithm, the capacity-limited version is shown to converge faster and reach better final policies.	O	O	Review	866
The paper then extends the basic version of the algorithm, which requires knowledge of the optimal value function, towards simultaneously learning the value function.	O	O	Review	866
While any theoretical guarantees are lost, the empirical results are still in line with the theoretical benefits, outperforming vanilla AC and producing better results in previously unencountered variations of the grid-world environment.	O	O	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper is very well written and the toy-examples illustrate the theoretical advantages in a very nice and intuitively understandable way.	O	O	Review	866
The topic of modeling capacity-limited RL agents and exploring how capacity-limitation is an advantage, rather than a ‚Äúbug‚Äù is very timely and important.	O	O	Review	866
In particular, rate-distortion theory might provide key-insights into building agents that generalize well, which is among the major open problems in reinforcement learning.	O	O	Review	866
The paper is thus very timely and highly relevant to a broad audience.	O	O	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The main weakness of the paper is that it is of quite limited novelty and that the brute-force approach towards using Blahut-Arimoto in RL is unlikely to scale to large, complex state-/action-spaces without major additional work.	B-Review	B-1	Review	866
Continuous state-/action-spaces are in principle covered by the theory, but they come with additional caveats and subtleties (I appreciate the authors using discrete notation with sums instead of integrals).	I-Review	I-1	Review	866
Additionally, when simultaneously learning the value function (in the online setting), any guarantees about Blahut-Arimoto convergence are lost.	B-Review	B-2	Review	866
However, solving either of these issues is hard and many attempts have been made in the communications community.	I-Review	I-2	Review	866
Despite these weaknesses I argue for accepting and presenting the paper at the conference for the following reasons: [line_break_token]- modelling capacity-limited agents via ideas from rate-distortion theory (which is very closely related to free-energy optimization, such as ELBO maximization, Bayesian inference and the MDL principle) is an underrated topic in reinforcement learning.	B-Review	B-3	Review	866
On a conceptual level, the strong idea is that moving away from strict optimization and infinite-capacity systems is not a shortcoming but can actually help building agents that perform better and generalize better.	I-Review	I-3	Review	866
This is not a well established idea in the community.	I-Review	I-3	Review	866
The paper does a good job at introducing the general idea, illustrating it intuitively with toy examples and pointing out relevant literature.	I-Review	I-3	Review	866
[line_break_token]- Simultaneously learning the value function is necessary in the RL setting, but breaks quite a bit of the theory.	B-Review	B-4	Review	866
However, very similar ideas seem to work quite well empirically in other settings, such as for instance ELBO maximization in VAEs, where the ‚Äúvalue function‚Äù is the log-likelihood (under the decoder), which is learned simultaneously while learning a ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù (the encoder) under capacity limitation (the KL term).	I-Review	I-4	Review	866
Similar arguments can be made for modern InfoBottleneck-style objectives in deep learning.	I-Review	I-4	Review	866
Based on this empirical observation, it is not unlikely that simultaneous learning of the value function works reasonably well without catastrophically collapsing in other settings and tasks.	I-Review	I-4	Review	866
[line_break_token]- While achieving a solution that strictly lies on the rate-distortion curve might be crucial in communications, it might be of lesser significance for building RL agents that generalize well - slight sub-optimalities (solutions that lie off the RD curve) should still yield interesting agents.	B-Review	B-5	Review	866
Therefore, losing theoretical guarantees might be less severe for simply exploring how much the idea can be scaled up empirically.	I-Review	I-5	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor issues:[line_break_token]1) While the paper, strictly speaking, introduces a novel algorithm and the Bellman loss function (which requires knowledge of the optimal value function), I think that the main contribution is a clear and well-focused introduction of rate-distortion theory in the context of RL, including very illustrative toy examples.	B-Review	B-6	Review	866
I do consider this an important contribution.	I-Review	I-6	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) Transfer to novel environments.	B-Review	B-7	Review	866
The final example (Fig.	I-Review	I-7	Review	866
4) does show that the capacity limited agent performs better in novel environments.	I-Review	I-7	Review	866
However, I‚Äôm not entirely convinced that this demonstrates ‚Äúsuperior transfer to novel environments‚Äù (from the abstract).	I-Review	I-7	Review	866
While the latter might very well arise from capacity-limitations, I think that in the example in the paper there is not too much transfer going on, but the capacity-limited agent simply has a more stochastic policy which helps if unknown walls are in the way.	I-Review	I-7	Review	866
After all, the average accumulated reward of the capacity limited agent does also decrease significantly in the novel environment - it simply does a slightly better random walk than the AC (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, of course).	I-Review	I-7	Review	866
On page 7, last paragraph this is phrased as: ‚Äúagents retain knowledge of exploratory actions‚Äù.	I-Review	I-7	Review	866
In my opinion this wording is a bit too strong to simply describe increased stochasticity.	I-Review	I-7	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) Since the paper does provide a good overview over the literature, I think it would help to mention that the current main approach towards generalizing (deep) RL is via hierarchical RL (options framework, etc) and provide a good reference.	B-Review	B-8	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4) At the very end of the intro you might also want to mention that rate-distortion has been used before in the context of decision-making (not RL), for instance under the term rational inattention.	B-Review	B-9	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]5) Page 5, last paragraph: the paper mentions that one Blahut-Arimoto iteration is enough.	B-Review	B-10	Review	866
This is an empirical observation, justified by the toy experiments.	I-Review	I-10	Review	866
However, the wording sounds like this is a generally known fact.	I-Review	I-10	Review	866
Please rephrase to emphasize that this must not necessarily hold true in general and that convergence behavior might crucially depend on this.	I-Review	I-10	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]6) It would be good to give readers some guidance towards choosing beta if doing an exhaustive grid-search is infeasible.	B-Review	B-11	Review	866
I am aware that there is no good general rule or recipe, but perhaps something can be added to the discussion (even if it is just mentioning that there is no good heuristic, etc. -	I-Review	I-11	Review	866
however, there should be plenty of research in communications that deals with estimating the RD curve from as few points as possible).	I-Review	I-11	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]7) Please consider adding this reference - it has a very similar objective function (but for navigating towards multiple goals) and is very much in line with some of the theoretical arguments.	B-Review	B-12	Review	866

Although there are a small handful of papers that have previously explored information-theoretic limits in RL (cited in our manuscript), this topic is, comparatively speaking, unexplored terrain.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	866

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding [B], we agree that substantial additional work would be needed to extend the current algorithm to large state/action spaces.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	866
The scope of the work involved prevents us from incorporating this into the manuscript within the author response period.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	866
However, this should not imply that the approach cannot be scaled up.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Our demonstration of the algorithm utilized a tabular representation of policy and value functions.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	866
Indeed, part of the value of this approach is to demonstrate that a tabular state representation does not preclude rational generalization.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	866
But there is nothing intrinsic to RD, RL, or their combination, that requires a tabular representation.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	866
Indeed, any standard function approximation scheme could be substituted into the current algorithm, from tile coding to deep NNs.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	866
We envision a policy represented as a neural network, with an information rate constraint placed on the training of the network.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	866
In other words, the network is trained to approximate an optimal capacity-limited channel (in the rate-distortion sense).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	866
In standard practice, overfitting is prevented (if it is considered at all) via careful design of the network architecture.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	866
In contrast, rate-distortion theory adds principled regularization that works regardless of the network architcture.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	866
While implementing and fully testing this idea would require substantial additional work, we feel that such an effort would be a major separate contribution, and does not diminish the value of the current work.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	866

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Summary:[line_break_token]The paper considers a very novel (but important) RL context where the agent has a constrained amount of information for representing a policy.	O	O	Review	866
 The authors use techniques from rate-distortion theory to generate a clever Bellman loss function that can be used (1) in a context where V*(s) is already known, and more importantly (2) with an actor-critic architecture (CL-AC) where the value function is being learned online.	O	O	Review	866
 CL-AC is shown to actually achieve higher converged and cumulative rewards than AC in many grid world domains and is shown to be advantageous in a transfer learning setting as well.	O	O	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Review:[line_break_token][line_break_token]The ideas in the paper are very well described and laid out.	O	O	Review	866
 The experiments are on grid worlds but for such a novel problem like this I think they are at the right level because they allow the reader to understand the results.	O	O	Review	866
 The empirical results are compelling, but I have a strong technical concern about the convergence issue noted by the authors (which was also communicated to the authors in a previous conference‚Äôs review session).	O	O	Review	866
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]My main concern is, as the authors noted, the required state occupation probability p(s) for RDT is approximated in a way that could lead to bad behavior in the RL algorithm.	B-Review	B-1	Review	866
 What we‚Äôre seeing here is the application of an RDT procedure that was designed for a static distribution being applied to a dynamic distribution of states (that can change based on the policy).	I-Review	I-1	Review	866
 In RL, there is no guarantee that the previous occupation probabilities have anything to do with the current policy‚Äôs induced distribution.	I-Review	I-1	Review	866
 In a hallway world with a decent reward down the left and a bigger reward to the right, an algorithm might start off by going down the left side several times, making the probabilities of states on the right 0.	I-Review	I-1	Review	866
 If I am reading the algorithm right, the states on the right are going to be essentially dismissed as unlikely, and the ‚Äúgo right‚Äù action (which is optimal) will likely be compressed out, since the states it should be used in are considered unlikely.	I-Review	I-1	Review	866
 More succinctly, early trajectories will bias p(s) and cause the algorithm to essentially want to optimize the policy for that distribution, likely causing it to stay in that distribution.	I-Review	I-1	Review	866
 Even more dangerously, there may be cases where this could cause the algorithm to thrash between policies as p(s) oscillates between different parts of the state space.	I-Review	I-1	Review	866
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]In order to improve this paper and make it suitable for publication, the authors should at least empirically demonstrate how different state occupation probability approximations affect the algorithm.	B-Review	B-2	Review	866
 A good example is the trace-decay probabilities mentioned (but not implemented) in the paper.	I-Review	I-2	Review	866
 If the paper compared that approach to the current approach, and showed an environment where one or both approaches failed to act correctly, that would complete the scientific result.	I-Review	I-2	Review	866
Right now, only one approximation is demonstrated, and as detailed above, its behavior is suspect.	I-Review	I-2	Review	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While most of the empirical results are well explained, the behavior in Figure 2B, where CL-AC is outperforming standard AC remain unclear.	B-Review	B-3	Review	866
I understand that in 2A (avg.	I-Review	I-3	Review	866
cumulative reward), CL-AC may be inducing a more efficient exploration policy and therefore the rewards during learning will be better.	I-Review	I-3	Review	866
 But in 2B, we are just looking at the final policy.	I-Review	I-3	Review	866
 Was standard AC not able to find the optimal policy after 100 episodes?	I-Review	I-3	Review	866
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]The results in the transfer learning context (Figure 3) are well done and produce a very interesting curve.	B-Review	B-4	Review	866
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]Reference 9 appears to only be available as an arXiv pre-print.	B-Review	B-5	Review	866
 Papers that have not been properly vetted by peer review should not be cited in an ICLR paper unless they are extremely necessary, which this does not appear to be.	I-Review	I-5	Review	866

[line_break_token]Thank you for your thorough review.	O	O	Reply	866
We greatly appreciate your time and feedback on this work.	O	O	Reply	866
We agree that the dynamic nature of learning implies that the simple tally approach explored here does not accurately represent the state occupancy distribution of the existing policy.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	866
We are currently exploring the implications of this fact, and applying an approach that uses a trace decay associated with each state.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	866
We recognize your concern and the possibility that divergence may occur between the learned policy and state distribution.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	866
To minimize this risk, we suggest that the approximated state distribution should change slowly relative to the policy, for example by using state eligibility traces with a slow decay rate or decaying the state distributions once per episode rather than once per every action selection.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	866
A discussion of these issues has been added to the revised version of the paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	866
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Although these methods offer a great deal of efficiency and flexibility, we agree that at present we can offer no guarantees of convergence, particularly when extending the current algorithm to large state/action spaces.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	866
Notably however, most guarantees for convergence in RL in general apply only to very limited circumstances, such as the tabular-based cases of TD algorithm methods (Sutton & Barto, 2018, p. 196).	O	O	Reply	866
As cautioned by Sutton & Barto (2018) convergence using stochastic approximation methods is not guaranteed unless restrictive conditions are met, such as infinite exploration or sufficiently small learning rates.	O	O	Reply	866
Most ‚Äúreal world‚Äù algorithms based on Deep-RL also lack convergence guarantees, especially when off-policy, nonlinear function approximation, and bootstrapping methods are combined in one RL algorithm, leading to the ‚Äúdeadly triad‚Äù issue (Sutton & Barto, 2018,  p. 249).	O	O	Reply	866
Of course, the theoretical possibility of divergence is less concerning in the face of empirical success.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	866
As we are developing a relatively novel approach within RL, we believe the first step is to demonstrate the algorithm's behavior in small-scale setting.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	866

This paper presents a generative sequence model based on the dilated CNN[line_break_token]popularized in models such as WaveNet.	O	O	Review	346
Inference is done via a hierarchical[line_break_token]variational approach based on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE).	O	O	Review	346
While VAE[line_break_token]approach has previously been applied to sequence modeling (I believe the[line_break_token]earliest being the VRNN of Chung et al (2015)), the innovation where is the[line_break_token]integration of a causal, dilated CNN in place of the more typical recurrent[line_break_token]neural network.	O	O	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The potential advantages of the use of the CNN in place of[line_break_token]RNN is (1) faster training (through exploitation of parallel computing across[line_break_token]time-steps), and (2) potentially (arguably) better model performance.	O	O	Review	346
This[line_break_token]second point is argued from the empirical results shown in the[line_break_token]literature.	O	O	Review	346
The disadvantage of the CNN approach presented here is that[line_break_token]these models still need to generate one sample at a time and since they are[line_break_token]typically much deeper than the RNNs, sample generation can be quite a bit[line_break_token]slower.	B-Review	B-1	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Novelty / Impact: This paper takes an existing model architecture (the[line_break_token]causal, dilated CNN) and applies it in the context of a variational[line_break_token]approach to sequence modeling.	O	O	Review	346
It's not clear to me that there are any[line_break_token]significant challenges that the authors overcame in reaching the proposed[line_break_token]method.	B-Review	B-2	Review	346
That said, it certainly useful for the community to know how the[line_break_token]model performs.	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Writing: Overall the writing is fairly good though I felt that the model[line_break_token]description could be made more clear by some streamlining -- with a single[line_break_token]pass through the generative model, inference model and learning.	B-Review	B-3	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experiments: The experiments demonstrate some evidence of the superiority[line_break_token]of this model structure over existing causal, RNN-based models.	O	O	Review	346
One point[line_break_token]that can be drawn from the results is that a dense architecture that uses multiple levels of the[line_break_token]latent variable hierarchy directly to compute the data likelihood is[line_break_token]quite effective.	O	O	Review	346
This observation doesn't really bear on the central message[line_break_token]of the paper regarding the use of causal, dilated CNNs.	B-Review	B-4	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The evidence lower-bound of the STCN-dense model on MNIST is so good (low)[line_break_token]that it is rather suspicious.	O	O	Review	346
There are many ways to get a deceptively good[line_break_token]result in this task, and I wonder if all due care what taken.	B-Review	B-5	Review	346
In[line_break_token]particular, was the binarization of the MNIST training samples fixed in[line_break_token]advance (as is standard) or were they re-binarized throughout training?	I-Review	I-5	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Detailed comments:[line_break_token]- The authors state "In contrast to related architectures (e.g. (Gulrajani et[line_break_token]al, 2016; Sonderby et al 2016)), the latent variables at the upper layers[line_break_token]capture information at long-range time scales" I believe that this is[line_break_token]incorrect in that the model proposed in at least Gulrajani et al also [line_break_token][line_break_token]- It also seems that there is an error in Figure 1 (left).	B-Review	B-6	Review	346
I don't think[line_break_token]there should be an arrow between z^{2}_{t,q} and z^{1}_{t,p}. The presence[line_break_token]of this link implies that the prior at time t would depend -- through[line_break_token]higher layers -- on the observation at t. This would no longer be a prior[line_break_token]at that point.	B-Review	B-7	Review	346
By extension you would also have a chain of dependencies[line_break_token]from future observations to past observations.	I-Review	I-7	Review	346
It seems like this issue is[line_break_token]isolated to this figure as the equations and the model descriptions are[line_break_token]consistent with an interpretation of the model without this arrow (and[line_break_token]including an arrow between z^{2}_{t,p} and z^{1}_{t,p}.[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The term "kla" appears in table 1, but it seems that it is otherwise not[line_break_token]defined.	B-Review	B-8	Review	346
I think this is the same term and meaning that appears in Goyal et[line_break_token]al. (	I-Review	I-8	Review	346
2017), but it should obviously be defined here.	I-Review	I-8	Review	346

This paper introduces a new stochastic neural network architecture for sequence modeling.	O	O	Review	346
The model as depicted in figure 2 has a ladder-like sequence of deterministic convolutions bottom-up and stochastic Gaussian units top-down.	O	O	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I'm afraid I have a handful of questions about aspects of the architecture that I found confusing.	O	O	Review	346
I have a difficult time relating my understanding of the architecture described in figure 2 with the architecture shown in figure 1 and the description of the wavenet building blocks.	B-Review	B-2	Review	346
My understanding of wavenet matches what is shown in the left of figure 1: the convolution layers d_t^l depend on the convolutional layers lower-down in the model, thus with each unit d^l having dependence which reaches further and further back in time as l increases.	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
I don't understand how to reconcile this with the computation graph in figure 2, which proposes a model which is Markov!	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
In figure 2, each d_{t-1}^l depends only on on the other d_{t-1} units and the value of x_{t-1}, which then (in the left diagram of figure 2) generate the following x_t, via the z_t^l.	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
Where did the dilated convolutions go‚Ä¶?	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
I thought at first this was just a simplification for the figure, but then in equation (4), there is d_t^l = Conv^{(l)}(d_t^{l-1}).	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
Shouldn't this also depend on d_{t-1}^{l-1}‚Ä¶?	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
or, where does the temporal information otherwise enter at all?	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
The only indication I could find is in equation (13), which has a hidden unit defined as d_t^1 = Conv^{(1)}(x_{1:t}).	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Adding to my confusion, perhaps, is the way that the "inference network" and "prior" are described as separate models, but sharing parameters.	B-Review	B-3	Review	346
It seems that, aside from the initial timesteps, there doesn't need to be any particular prior or inference network at all: there is simply a transition model from x_{t-1} to x_{t}, which would correspond to the Markov operator shown in the left and middle sections of figure 2.	I-Review	I-3	Review	346
Why would you ever need the right third of figure 2?	I-Review	I-3	Review	346
This is a model that estimates z_t given x_t.	I-Review	I-3	Review	346
But, aside from at time 0, we already have a value x_{t-1}, and a model which we can use to estimate z_t  given x_{t-1}‚Ä¶!	I-Review	I-3	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]What are the top-to-bottom functions f^{(l)} and f^{(o)}?	B-Review	B-4	Review	346

[line_break_token][line_break_token]I also was confused in the experiments by the >= and <= on the reported numbers.	O	O	Review	346
For example, in table 2, the text describes the values displayed as log-likelihoods, in which case the ELBO represents a lower bound.	B-Review	B-5	Review	346
However, in that case, why is the bolded value the *lowest* log-likelihood?	I-Review	I-5	Review	346
That would be the worst model, not the best ‚Äî does table 2 actually show negative log-likelihoods, then?	I-Review	I-5	Review	346
In which case, though, the numbers from the ELBO should be upper bounds, and the >= should be <=.	O	O	Review	346
Looking at figure 4, it seems like visually the STCN and VRNN have very good reconstructions, but the STCN-dense has visual artifacts; this would correspond with the numbers in table 2 being log-likelihoods (not negative), in which case I am confused only by the choice of which model to bold.

FWIW I still find the depiction of the architecture in Figure 2 to be incredibly misleading, as well as the decision to omit dependencies from the distributions p and q at the top of page 5, as well as the use in table 3 of "ELBO" to refer to a *negative* log likelihood.	B-Review	B-1	Review	346

The focus on novelty (mentioned in both the abstract, and conclusion as a direct claim) in the presentation hurts the paper overall.	O	O	Review	346
Without stronger comparison to other closely related work, and lack of citation to several closely related models, the claim of novelty isn't defined well enough to be useful.	B-Review	B-1	Review	346
Describing what parts of this model are novel compared to e.g. Stochastic WaveNet or the conditional dilated convolutional decoder of "Improved VAE for Text ..." (linked below, among many others) would help strengthen the novelty claim, if the claim of novelty is needed or useful at all.	I-Review	I-1	Review	346
Stochastic WaveNet in particular seems very closely related to this work, as does PixelVAE.	I-Review	I-1	Review	346
In addition, use of autoregressive models conditioned on (non-variational, in some sense) latents have been shown in both VQ-VAE and ADA among others, so a discussion would help clarify the novelty claim.	I-Review	I-1	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Empirical results are strong, though (related to the novelty issue) there should be greater comparison both quantitatively and qualitatively to further work.	B-Review	B-4	Review	346
In particular, many of the papers linked below show better empirical results on the same datasets.	I-Review	I-4	Review	346
Though the results are not always directly comparable, a discussion of *why* would be useful - similar to how Z-forcing was included.	I-Review	I-4	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the qualitative analysis, it would be good to see a more zoomed out view of the text (as in VRNN), since one of the implicit claims of the improvement from dense STCN is improved global coherence by direct connection to the "global latents".	B-Review	B-2	Review	346
As it stands now the text samples are a bit too local to really tell.	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
In addition, the VRNN samples look quite a bit different than what the authors present in their work - what implementation was used for the VRNN samples (they don't appear to be clips from the original paper)?	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]On the MNIST setting, there are many missing numbers in the table from related references (some included below), and the >= 60.25 number seems so surprising as to be (possibly) incorrect - more in-depth analysis of this particular result is needed.	O	O	Review	346

Paper's Claims[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper introduces a new unsupervised abstractive summarization approach called TED, using a Transformer encoder and decoder.	O	O	Review	346
Their main contributions are as follows:[line_break_token]1) Pretraining the encoder and decoder on news articles using the first beginning as the target summary.	O	O	Review	346
[line_break_token]2) Fine-tune on other datasets using so-called theme modeling, and separately a denoising loss.	O	O	Review	346
[line_break_token]3) TED's performance is claimed to significantly improve over GPT-2 while not being too far from the best unsupervised extractive summarization results.	O	O	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Decision[line_break_token][line_break_token]Edit: After revisions and discussions, I recommend we accept this paper.	O	O	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I am leaning towards accepting this paper mostly because of the contribution #1 above.	O	O	Review	346
Unsupervised learning using large quantities of text that have the property of being typically written in a style that synthesizes information in the first 1-3 sentences is a powerful idea.	O	O	Review	346
That the performance is improved compared to other unsupervised abstractive summarization confirms the importance of this approach.	O	O	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]However the importance of and justification for the fine-tuning steps are comparatively much more limited in my opinion.	O	O	Review	346
Also, some important details about the preprocessing for pre-training appear to be missing and they could be quite important.	O	O	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Detailed arguments for decision[line_break_token][line_break_token]I view this effort as aiming to reproduce the BERT approach in the context of abstractive summarization, which is a good idea.	O	O	Review	346
The most clever contribution is in leveraging un-labeled text using the first few sentences as the target summary for pretraining.	O	O	Review	346
The results of just this part are already beating previous approaches, while not requiring any in-domain data, which is quite powerful.	O	O	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]However, some relatively important details regarding the methodology are omitted or only glossed over and it would greatly contribute to making this work more reproducible if the details were included (see my detailed notes below, notably regarding section 2.2).	B-Review	B-1	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]On the fine-tuning steps, I have several worries.	B-Review	B-2	Review	346
First, why not fine-tune using supervised learning, as would be the analog to the BERT approach?	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
Instead the authors go out of their way to do in-domain unsupervised learning, which provides a boost, yes, but still doesn't compare positively to extractive and/or supervised methods.	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
Second, why not perform the theme modeling and denoising also -- or rather only -- on the unlabelled pretraining data?	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
Why should it be done on the in-domain fine-tuning data instead (while not using the most valuable piece of in-domain information, namely the example summaries)?	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
After all, it's a fully unsupervised approach and it can actually be performed on any text at all, whether a summary for it exists or not.	I-Review	I-2	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Again regarding the unsupervised approach, and to push the BERT analogy further, I'm wondering why not initialize the pretraining model with a BERT-style trained model?	B-Review	B-3	Review	346
After all we could imagine building a system that adds more and more in-domain characteristics sequentially: first pretrain a BERT model, then fine-tune to summarization using what this paper calls pretraining, and then finally fine-tune again to a specific summarization domain.	I-Review	I-3	Review	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]So, to conclude, I find that this paper goes in the right direction and introduces important ideas for pretraining and fine tuning unsupervised abstractive summarization models, but that some decisions about how to use the various ideas (theme and denoising but no supervised learning, in-domain vs during pretraining) have not been explored enough.

There could be articles about the same exact events, years apart, for example.	I-Review	I-7	Review	346

[line_break_token]Figure 1: I find the upper part of this figure very confusing.	B-Review	B-13	Review	346
Why are there arrows going from the encoder/decoder to a summary, to theme loss, to article and back to encoder/decoder?	I-Review	I-13	Review	346
It's important that the summary is never seen by the theme loss otherwise it's not unsupervised anymore, and I also don't see why the arrow would go through article *after* theme loss.	I-Review	I-13	Review	346
I assume there must have been a mistake, please fix.	I-Review	I-13	Review	346
[line_break_token]section 2.4: "the sequence is slightly shuffled by applying a permutation /sigma such that ..." The formula given here tells me that all token indices are shuffled with another token within a window k. That seems like a lot of moving around, and also depending on the implementation a token from the beginning could possibly end up at the very tail of the sentence by being picked iteratively again and again, thus falling outside the permutation distance k. Please provide more details on how this is done and a justification for why it was decided to do it this way.	B-Review	B-14	Review	346
[line_break_token]Section 3.1: I'd like to know how long (preferably number of words, or at least number of wordpiece tokens) the summaries generated are.	B-Review	B-15	Review	346
What determines how long they are, is it a fixed size, or the model decides to stop on his own (or when hitting some limit), or something else?	I-Review	I-15	Review	346
[line_break_token]section 4.2: Do you have any idea why your unsupervised approach yields more novel n-grams than a the supervised model you compare against?	B-Review	B-5	Review	346
This can be good as much as it can be bad, in that it could be going off-track.	I-Review	I-5	Review	346

Short articles are filtered since the information might be too condensed and not suitable for summarization pretraining.	I-Reply	I-9	Reply	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]10 and 150 words: Some leading sentences are extremely short, e.g. one or two words phrases.	I-Reply	I-9	Reply	346
Those are filtered since they have too little information to be reasonable summaries.	I-Reply	I-9	Reply	346
Longer leading sentences are removed to reduce the pretraining time.	I-Reply	I-9	Reply	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]0.65: The overlap ratio is an indicator of the amount of information that the leading sentences maintain.	I-Reply	I-9	Reply	346
For instance,  in CNN/DM dataset, the median of the overlapping ratio of non-stopping words between golden summary and the article is 0.87, and the ratio between the first 3 sentences and the rest of the article is 0.77 (median).	I-Reply	I-9	Reply	346
Setting the number at 0.65 makes the final training set size fit with the available computation resources and ensures that the leading sentences contain enough information.	I-Reply	I-9	Reply	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We mean to have demanding filtering criteria since we want high-quality pretraining data.	I-Reply	I-9	Reply	346

The ‚Äúsummary‚Äù refers to the generated summary from the transformer encoders/decoders, not the groundtruths summaries.	I-Reply	I-13	Reply	346

Here is how we generate the permutations (the variable perm) of the indices using numpy.	I-Reply	I-14	Reply	346
Assume the length of the sequence is L, and the window size is k.[line_break_token]ids = np.arange(L)[line_break_token]noise =  np.random.uniform(0, k, size = L)[line_break_token]tmp = ids + noise[line_break_token]perm = tmp.argsort()[line_break_token]For tokens in the beginning, e.g. the first token, since there are at most k -1 elements smaller than tmp[0] in tmp, so the first token is at most shuffled to the kth position.	I-Reply	I-14	Reply	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The motivation of shuffling is as follows.	I-Reply	I-14	Reply	346
The information is to extract and summarize is scattered across an article.	I-Reply	I-14	Reply	346
By applying this shuffling noise, we want our model to learn to recognize and reorganize the information.	I-Reply	I-14	Reply	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token](12) The generation has a hard limit, which is decided on the validation dataset.	B-Reply	B-15	Reply	346
For instance, the maximum generation length for CNN/DM dataset is 175.	I-Reply	I-15	Reply	346
Also, in beam search, if the generated token is &lt;EOS&gt;, i.e. the end of sentence, then the generation is terminated immediately for the current sequence.	O	O	Reply	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token](13) Since TED is an abstractive model, this experiment is to show that TED has the ability to summarize using words/phrases not in the original article, which is typical in human-edited summaries.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	346
Explanations why TED has more novel grams could be TED has seen more data during the pretraining phase than PGNet (which is only trained using in-domain data).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	346

[line_break_token][line_break_token](3) Thanks for mentioning MeanSum and we have referenced it in the paper.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	346
The reasons why we didn‚Äôt include MeanSum are:[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, MeanSum is for multi-document summarization, while the baseline models we are comparing are for single document.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Second, the denoising in TED is quite different from the reconstruction idea in MeanSum.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	346
In TED‚Äôs denoising, the corrupted text are input to the transformer and the model is trained to filter the added noises.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	346
Note the original (clean) text is not used as inputs or seen by TED in the forward pass.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	346
However, the reconstruction process in MeanSum follows that it inputs multiple documents to RNN, generate the summaries (the encoded reviews), and then reconstruct each document from the summaries.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Third, the same reconstruction idea is also used in a baseline single document summarization model SEQ3 (NAACL 19) that we compared with in the paper, which is published at almost the same time as MeanSum (ICML 19).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	346
Similar to MeanSum, SEQ3 tries to reconstruct the the single document from the generated summary.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	346
As shown in table 2, TED outperforms SEQ3 by significant margins.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	346
[line_break_token][line_break_token]TED is innovative compared with both MeanSum and SEQ3.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	346
First MeanSum and SEQ3 both use RNN, while TED builds on transformer.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	346
Second, although both MeanSum and SEQ3 have a loss to make make the summary similar to the input article, it is implemented as the classical cosine similarity.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	346
In contrast, TED innovatively encodes the similarity by the transformer encoder in a BERT-style.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	346

The aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical analysis of adversarial training under the linear classification setting.	O	O	Review	20351
The main result states that, under many technical assumptions,  adversarial training using gradient descent may converge to the hard margin SVM classifier with a fast rate.	O	O	Review	20351
Here "fast" is not the standard 1/T fast rates but, rather, a rate of o(1/log T) (in comparison to recent results that looked into the convergence of gradient descent with logistic loss to the hard-margin SVM solution).	B-Review	B-7	Review	20351
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, the paper is not recommended for publication for many reasons.	O	O	Review	20351
[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, the notation used is sometimes imprecise and in some cases it is entirely wrong.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20351
For example, the authors decided to use x_i to replace the product y _i x_i in order to "simplify" notation.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20351
This makes things really hard to follow.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20351
The authors need to use a different symbol, such as z to stand for the product yx.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20351
Second, some equations do not appear to be correctly typed (e.g. in Page 1, standard learning should have xi not x).	I-Review	I-1	Review	20351
Third, the authors use epsilon to denote two different things (one for the definition of linearly separable data and one for the robustness radius), and so on.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20351
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Second, the paper needs to be proof-read.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20351
It has a lot of typos and grammatical errors that make sentences difficult to understand.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20351
Examples include: [line_break_token]- "while there several outliers are not or even not linearly separable", [line_break_token]- "a simple generalization error bound informs the high loss on test set"[line_break_token][line_break_token]Third, some of the mathematical results do not make sense.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20351
For example,  Definition 1 has two conditions, the first one is immediately satisfied once the second condition is satisfied, so why both?	I-Review	I-3	Review	20351
Also, in Proposition 1, the authors should mention that both sets are subsets of a linearly separable superset.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20351
In that case, the conclusion of Proposition 1 is obvious.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20351
Definitely, if data are linearly separable, then the hard margin will shrink as more examples are added (it cannot increase by definition of "maximum" margin).	I-Review	I-3	Review	20351
Moreover, in Example 1, the authors conclude with an inequality of norms and I don't see how this follows from the description of the example.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20351
The example is generic and there is nothing that indicates one norm would be larger than the other.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20351
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Forth, the authors make many assumptions about the loss without mentioning one example that satisfies them.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20351
In fact, the loss function they used later in the experiments violates Assumption 2.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20351
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Some additional comments: [line_break_token]- How did the authors arrive at Eq 4?	B-Review	B-5	Review	20351
I don't see how this follows from the assumptions.	I-Review	I-5	Review	20351
Can you please elaborate?	I-Review	I-5	Review	20351
[line_break_token]- I am not aware of any book written by Vapnik in 1995 called "Convex Optimization".	I-Review	I-5	Review	20351
I think the authors meant the SVM paper.	I-Review	I-5	Review	20351
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Given all of these issues and the fact that the main result is incremental and holds under a very limited setting (homogenous linear classifiers under a strong separability assumption) and relies on very strong assumptions about the loss function that may not be achievable to begin with, I do not recommend acceptance.	B-Review	B-6	Review	20351
[line_break_token][line_break_token]=========== [line_break_token]#Post Rebuttal Remarks[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding the rate of convergence, just to be clear, I was only clarifying what the term "fast" meant in the paper, not complaining.	B-Review	B-7	Review	20351
So, this did not affect my score.	I-Review	I-7	Review	20351
The notation issues need to be fixed and the authors need to ensure that mathematical equations are written precisely, as stated in my review.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20351
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Thanks for clarifying the issue about the loss functions.	O	O	Review	20351
I agree that the example they mentioned satisfy it but it is not a common loss used in practice.	O	O	Review	20351
ÄúHere "fast" is not the standard 1/T fast rates but, rather, a rate of o(1/log T)‚Äù[line_break_token]We try to reveal the actual convergence rate of adversarial training to robust solution rather than developing a faster algorithm to obtain a robust solution.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	20351
Hence, we think the result is valuable, even though the promotion is not surprising large to O(1/T).	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	20351
[line_break_token]‚Äúthe authors decided to use x_i to replace the product y _i x_i in order to "simplify" notation.	O	O	Reply	20351
‚Äù[line_break_token]We would like to clarify the notations here and accordingly revise them in the paper.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20351
First, representing y_i x_i by x_i is out of the consideration that x_i and y_i are always appear as x_i y_i and w^{T}x_i y_i means the data is correctly classified.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20351
The symbol will not mislead the notations.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20351
We will substitute the \epsilon in definition 2 with some other symbol.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20351
[line_break_token]‚ÄúThird, some of the mathematical results do not make sense‚Äù[line_break_token]The two conditions in definition 1 are used to emphasis that w^{*} can not only make a correct classification for each data but also ensure each data is away from the margin larger than \epsilon.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20351
We will get rid of the first condition in the next version.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20351
The condition that union data is linearly separable is necessary to make proposition meaningful.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20351
We will then add it.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20351
The example 1 is used to give an intuitively explanation to proposition 1.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20351
It can be concluded as the hard margin solution can be sensitive to outliers closely with each other, but standard training can converge to hard margin solution which informs the unstability of standard training.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20351
The equation (12) is a direct induction to reveal the x_{i}^{1} will locate closely to the new hard margin solution (\hat{w}_{1}, \hat{w}_{2}) due to some outliers \x_{i}^{2} are added, while they locate away from their original hard margin solution (\hat{\w}_{1}, 0).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20351
[line_break_token]‚ÄúForth, the authors make many assumptions about the loss without mentioning one example that satisfies them‚Äù[line_break_token]We enumerate some loss functions satisfy our assumptions in the footnote of page 3.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	20351
For example, choosing loss function l(u) as e^{-u} or \log{1+e^{-u}} can satisfy with our assumptions.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20351
Also please notice that assumption 2 exponential tail focuses on the behavior of loss function l(u) when u is large.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20351
We chose l(u)=\log{1+e^{-u}} which will closely to e^{-u} when u is large.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20351
A simple inequality that \log{1+x} \geq x ‚Äì x^{2}/2 can give the exact conclusion.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20351
[line_break_token]‚ÄúHow did the authors arrive at Eq 4‚Äù[line_break_token]It is a directly result according to the linear classifier and monotonically decreasing property of loss function l(u).	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	20351
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚Äúunder a very limited setting (homogenous linear classifiers under a strong separability assumption)‚Äù[line_break_token]Our assumptions about loss function can be achieved by the most generally used loss functions i.e. e^{-u}, \log{1+e^{-u}}. Also about the assumption ‚Äústrongly separability‚Äù, it is equivalent to the data are linearly separable, because if the data are separable, then there must exist a \epsilon&gt;0 such that w^{*T}x_{i} \geq \epsilon\|\w^{*}\|. Then the data can satisfy our ‚Äú\epsilon-strongly linearly separable‚Äù.	O	O	Reply	20351
Hence, our core assumption is the data are themselves linearly separable.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	20351
Besides that, we also give a discussion to adversarial training on non-linearly separable data.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	20351

This paper provides some analyses of the difference between adversarial training and standard training for linear classification problem.	O	O	Review	20351

[line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	20351
I am not sure about the significance of the results in the paper.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20351
The results highly depend on the linear setting with convex losses.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20351
More than that, Theorem 1 assumes the \eps strongly linear separable, and Theorem 2 assumes a large \eps (if the statement is that |w* x_{k,i}| is less than a large number, it seems much less interesting).	I-Review	I-2	Review	20351
These are very strong assumptions that are usually not true in practice.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20351
Experimental results only cover carefully designed simulation as well.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20351

The paper describes a pipeline for image compression which allows to reliably detect specific manipulation patterns in compressed images.	O	O	Review	350
 The results show that it is possible to learn image compression that performs similarly to a modern image compression algorithm while in the same time is optimized to reveal specific kinds of manipulations.	O	O	Review	350
The authors build upon (Korus &amp; Memon, 2019), but use a learnable codec instead of differentiable JPEG.	O	O	Review	350
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The idea to regularize entropy of the latent representation of images is interesting.	O	O	Review	350
A method to train a well-performing image compression system which can also follow additional constraints (such as ability to reveal certain manipulations) is very valuable for practice.	O	O	Review	350
Unfortunately, there are already available trainable compression methods and the authors do not compare to these methods.	B-Review	B-1	Review	350
However, in my opinion to detect manipulation in the image one should prove that visual content in some area of the image was significantly changed with respect to some original, while in the other parts of the image it was not changed.	I-Review	I-1	Review	350
Otherwise it becomes impossible to distinguish in-camera filtering and secondary postprocessing.	I-Review	I-1	Review	350
Basically, the authors present a method to detect whether a very particular configuration of some basic image processing filters (Gaussian blur, median filter, resampling)  was applied to the image.	I-Review	I-1	Review	350

Next, poor performance of JPEG manipulation detection by the proposed  network does not prove that JPEG manipulation cannot be detected, it just shows that the proposed architecture does not perform well in this problem.	I-Review	I-2	Review	350
A comparative study which relates a new system to a current state of the art is required to claim that a proposed approach is better.	I-Review	I-2	Review	350
Finally, SSIM is not a standard way to compute image quality.	I-Review	I-2	Review	350
MS-SSIM and PSNR are also popular, and a user study is usually recommended to claim that some method generates images of better visual quality.	I-Review	I-2	Review	350

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Our setup involves a forensic analysis network which learns to distinguish basic image manipulations.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	350
This corresponds to a well-established foundational test scenario, which can later be built upon to deliver practical manipulation detection algorithms.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	350
Once the model learns to distinguish different image processing paths, it will respond differently to content coming from different sources.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	350
For example, if an object is inserted or removed from a photo, that region is likely to solicit a different response than the rest of the image.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	350

The results aren't state of the art in terms of rate-distortion performance, but this paper has a very good analysis of the results, and has produced a very fast codec.	O	O	Review	350

This paper proposes APPROXLINE, which is a sound approximation to EXACTLINE and is able to compute tight deterministic bounds on probabilities efficiently when the input is restricted on a line.	O	O	Review	608
It is a nonconvex relaxation, therefore it is able to capture the nonconvexity of neural networks.	O	O	Review	608
APPROXLINE is applied to generative models to verify the consistency of image attributes through linear interpolations on the latent variables.	O	O	Review	608
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To me, the most significant part is that the proposed approach has the potential to become a reliable metric for evaluating whether a generator disentangles latent representations, as long as a reliable attribute classifier can be trained.	B-Review	B-3	Review	608
I would suggest the authors to emphasize this part in their future versions.	I-Review	I-3	Review	608
[line_break_token][line_break_token]However, the current version is quite difficult for me to understand, and I guess it is difficult for a broad range of audiences without background in program analysis.	B-Review	B-1	Review	608

summary:[line_break_token]The paper proposes a method to efficiently verify that generative models are consistent with respect to some known (latent) attribute.	O	O	Review	608
The authors defines attribute consistency by 1) mapping pairs of input (x1, x2) with matching attribute to a latent space using an encoder n_E(x) and 2) measuring how correctly an auxiliary classifier will classify the known attribute using (decoded) linear interpolations between the two latent encodings.	O	O	Review	608
Importantly, the proposed method gives guaranteed bounds on this consistency score, as opposed to simply evaluating the classifier on a fixed set uniformly sampled points between x1 and x2.	O	O	Review	608
In experiments the authors use their method to test for attribute independence as well as consistency under left-right flipping of an image using two different autoencoder models (VAE and CycleAE) obtaining tighter bounds on the ‚Äòattribute consistency‚Äô score than competing methods.	O	O	Review	608
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]Decision &amp; supporting arguments:[line_break_token]Conceptually I found the paper very appealing, and it tackles an important problem in generative modelling.	O	O	Review	608
However I have some concerns with respect to the paper in its current state:[line_break_token]1) It is not clear to me why the attribute consistency score, a key component in the paper, is a good measure of consistency in generative models.	B-Review	B-1	Review	608
Notably, I miss motivation for why linear interpolations between encoded inputs should necessarily keep the attribute stable.	I-Review	I-1	Review	608
[line_break_token]2) Although I found the experiments interesting, I did not find the experimental section completely comprehensive.	B-Review	B-2	Review	608
There is no discussion or experiments probing the dependency on the quality of the auxiliary classifier or the encoder/decoder model used.	I-Review	I-2	Review	608
[line_break_token]3) I did not find the description of the proposed method to be reasonably self-contained.	B-Review	B-3	Review	608
Especially section 3 which describes the proposed method is challenging to follow.	I-Review	I-3	Review	608
The background material in section 2 reads very much like a set of definitions.	I-Review	I-3	Review	608
Since ICLR has a quite broad audience, I think the paper should be written in a more pedagogical way, with for instance clarifying examples.	I-Review	I-3	Review	608
An example of a sentence that is incredibly hard to parse is on page 4, describing domain lifting: ‚ÄúAny deterministic abstract domain can be directly interpreted as a probabilistic abstract domain, where the concretization of an element is given as the set of probability measures whose support is a subset of the set produced by the deterministic concretization.	I-Review	I-3	Review	608
‚Äù I think making this paper more pedagogical requires major rewriting.	I-Review	I-3	Review	608
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Due to the above reasons I currently score the paper as a ‚Äòweak reject‚Äô.	O	O	Review	608
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Further detailed questions/comments:[line_break_token]Consistency Score[line_break_token]Q1: What is the motivation behind the definition of the consistency attribute score.	B-Review	B-4	Review	608
Especially, why is an attribute considered consistent if it is stable to linear interpolations in the latent space?	I-Review	I-4	Review	608
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experiment Results:[line_break_token]Q2.1: Did you perform any experiments on how the L1 score of the auxiliary classifier affects the consistency score?	B-Review	B-5	Review	608
I would also like to see some quantitative numbers on the auxiliary classifier.	I-Review	I-5	Review	608
[line_break_token]Q2.2: Why is the L1 score used for training the classifier instead of bernoulli which seems more natural for binary attributes?	B-Review	B-6	Review	608
[line_break_token]Q2.3: Similarly, I would like to see some numbers on the quality of the encoder/decodes.	B-Review	B-7	Review	608
Simply inspecting the interpolations in figure 3) the reconstructions seem quite blurry, likely due to the relatively small models used.	I-Review	I-7	Review	608
Is it prohibitively expensive to run the proposed method on bigger models (e.g. ResNet based encoder/decoders or Unet-style models)?	I-Review	I-7	Review	608
[line_break_token]Q2.4: I believe it would be more informative to show the actual confidence intervals in figure 2b) instead of only the width of the confidence intervals?	B-Review	B-8	Review	608
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Readability:[line_break_token]Q3: I found it quite challenging to understand how the proposed is implemented in practice - My suggestion is that the authors add a pseudo-code / algorithm to section 3 clarifying exactly how the bounds reported in the experimental section are calculated.

 We will answer in two parts.	O	O	Reply	608
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q1.1: It is not clear to me why the attribute consistency score, a key component in the paper, is a good measure of consistency in generative models.	O	O	Reply	608
Notably, I miss motivation for why linear interpolations between encoded inputs should necessarily keep the attribute stable.	O	O	Reply	608
[line_break_token][line_break_token]There have been a wealth of papers that propose autoencoder/generative model systems that claim that linear interpolations produce "interpretable" results [1-11]. It is in fact possible that not all defined attributes for a dataset should be preserved under "interpretable" interpolations.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	608
For example, interpolating between a person with only a beard and the same person with only a mustache would likely fail to satisfy the disjunctive attribute "no beard or no mustache."	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	608
However, for many attributes we do expect intuitively consistency along interpolations between examples with those attributes, such as "has blond hair."	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	608
One can examine the named attributes provided with CelebA to decide whether they should remain consistent among interpolations (we believe they should).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	608
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Interestingly, this brings up the important point that deciding whether an attribute should correspond to a direction in the encoded representation for a dataset is likely a subjective question.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	608
We do not claim to answer this.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	608
Rather, our system attempts to verify this for a given dataset and given property.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	608
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q1.2: Especially, why is an attribute considered consistent if it is stable to linear interpolations in the latent space?	O	O	Reply	608
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We clarify that we do not measure the consistency of an attribute in vacuum, but with respect to a particular autoencoder.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	608
An attribute which is consistent for one autoencoder might very well be inconsistent for another autoencoder, and this is not a judgement on the consistency of the attribute as much as it is a judgement on the consistency of the autoencoder.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	608

Summary[line_break_token][line_break_token]This work aims to provide warranties on the outputs of generative models by providing bounds on robustness&nbsp;(over adversarial attacks for instance, or other transformation in this case).	O	O	Review	608
The specific case of restricting the inputs to a line segment allows performing verification of robustness exactly (Exact-line approach, NeurIPS'19).	O	O	Review	608
The authors extend this work and apply it to verify robustness of some VAE and BEGAN like models.	O	O	Review	608

[line_break_token]- The work, an extension of the Exact-line approach, only gives a 5 lines description which is not insufficient to understand the approach.&nbsp;[line_break_token][line_break_token]Perhaps my assessment is too negative because I am unfamiliar with the certification literature, but since the work present applications in generative modeling, I think it should be understandable by readers from this background as well.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[line_break_token]Minor:[line_break_token]of of in caption of Fig 2[line_break_token]last line of page 5: J -&gt; j[line_break_token]I found the equivalence sign in the last equation of page 6 confusing, is it really supposed to be an equivalence here?&nbsp;[line_break_token]Page 6 : attribute detector... described below -&gt; in appendix[line_break_token][line_break_token]After seeing the authors changes in the manuscript the paper does look better, but similarly to Reviewer 2 I still judge it difficult to understand.

This paper proposes two methods for instance-wise feature importance scoring, which is the task of ranking the importance of each feature in a particular example (in contrast to class-wise or overall feature importance).	O	O	Review	386
 The approach uses Shapely values, which are a principled way of measuring the contribution of a feature, and have been previously used in feature importance ranking.	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The difficulty with Shapely values is they are extremely (exponentially) expensive to compute, and the contribution of this paper is to provide two efficient methods of computing approximate Shapely values when there is a known structure (a graph) relating the features to each other.	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper first introduces the L(ocal)-Shapely value, which arises by restricting the Shapely value to a neighbourhood of the feature of interest.	O	O	Review	386
 The L-Shapely value is still expensive to compute for large neighbourhoods, but can be tractable for small neighbourhoods.	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The second approximation is the C(onnected)-Shapely value, which further restricts the L-Shapely computation to only consider connected subgraphs of local neighbourhoods.	O	O	Review	386
 The justification for restricting to connected neighbourhoods is given through a connection to the Myerson value, which is somewhat obscure to me, since I am not familiar with the relevant literature.	O	O	Review	386
 Nonetheless, it is clear that for the graphs of interest in this paper (chains and lattices) restricting to connected neighbourhoods is a substantial savings.	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I have understood the scores presented in Figures 2 and 3 as follows:[line_break_token][line_break_token]For each feature of each example, rank the features according to importance, using the plugin estimate for P(Y|X_S) where needed.	B-Review	B-1	Review	386
[line_break_token]For each "percent of features masked" compute log(P(y_true | x_{S\top features})) - log(P(y_true | x)) using the plugin estimate, and average these values over the dataset.	I-Review	I-1	Review	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Based on this understanding the results are quite good.	O	O	Review	386
 The approximate Shapely values do a much better job than their competitors of identifying highly relevant features based on this measure.	O	O	Review	386
 The qualitative results are also quite compelling, especially on images where C-Shapely tends to select contiguous regions which is intuitively correct behavior.	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Comparing the different methods in Figure 4, there is quite some variability in the features selected by using different estimators of Shapley values.	O	O	Review	386
 I wonder is there some way to attack the problem of distinguishing when a feature is ranked highly when its (exact) Shapley value is high versus when it is ranked highly as an artifact of the estimator?	B-Review	B-2	Review	386

[line_break_token][line_break_token]In response to your questions about our entity linking results we have updated our experiments to be more in line with other entity linking approaches.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	386
First, we have adopted the same CoNLL alias table used by most other recent approaches.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	386

Third we have updated provided the RELIC model with the start of each document, as well as the immediate context surrounding each entity mention.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Together, these modifications have brought RELIC's performance up to match the state of the art on CoNLL (94.9%), and second only to DeepType on TAC-KBP (RELIC: 89.8%, DeepType: 90.9%).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	386
DeepType relies on the large Wikidata knowledge base for entity representations and we consider it significant that RELIC can match this system's performance with embeddings learned purely from context.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	386

[line_break_token][line_break_token]As well as reporting the performance of the RELIC model that has been tuned toward the entity linking task (CoNLL + Aida tuning), we do still report the performance of the pure RELIC model that has never seen any in-domain data, and which does not have access to any alias table.

[line_break_token]This paper aims to learn entity representations by aggregating all the contexts that an entity appears in based on English Wikipedia.	O	O	Review	386

The training process is similar as word2vec, and they leveraged all the hyperlinks in Wikipedia, and used BERT to encode the context (instead of learning a context vector for each word).	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As a result, the paper demonstrates that this set of entity embeddings are highly useful, and they were evaluated on 1) entity-level typing 2) entity linking 3) few-shot category reconstruction 4) answering trivia questions (TriviaQA).	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I think this is a nice empirical paper and the experiments are thorough.	O	O	Review	386

It is a bit surprising that nobody has experimented with this before.	I-Review	I-2	Review	386

The paper describes a new way of learning context dependent entity representations that are capable of encoding fine-grained entity types.	O	O	Review	386
This is realised by matching entities to all their contexts and thereby encoding all their properties.	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token]The contribution is RELIC, a table of entity representations that are learned given the above objective.	O	O	Review	386
This table, RELIC, can be used in various tasks like entity typing, entity linking and question answering.	O	O	Review	386
Given a corpus of entities and their respective contexts, the probability of an entity occurring under its context is maximised (additionally, the probability is minimised for negative samples).	O	O	Review	386
The data is taken from a Wikipedia dump.	O	O	Review	386
Without adding further information, the RELIC table can directly be used for entity linking.	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token]In the entity linking task, RELIC achieves a lower precision at two benchmarks (CoNLL-Aida, TAC-KBP 2010) than other approaches.	O	O	Review	386
This can be tackled by fine-tuning the RELIC table, which is done with the training set from the CoNLL-Aida task.	O	O	Review	386
With fine-tuning, comparable results are achieved.	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token]For entity typing, RELIC embeddings of entities are used as input for a 2-layer FF network, which then outputs which types belong to the entity.	O	O	Review	386
The FIGMENT and TypeNet datasets are used as benchmark here and it is shown that the RELIC based approach outperforms the other approaches.	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token]RELIC is also used for a category completion task, where a category is represented by a centroid of three randomly sampled entities belonging to it.	O	O	Review	386
The entities from RELIC are then ranked with the dot-product with the centroid.	O	O	Review	386
Two tasks are used to measure the performance here: the TypeNet completion task and a Wikipedia-based task.	O	O	Review	386
Compared to embeddings of a 2017 approach, the RELIC embeddings perform better.	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token]Finally, a QA task is performed using RELIC.	O	O	Review	386
Here, the questions are modelled as contexts and the entity which is closest in terms of cosine similarity is taken as answer.	O	O	Review	386
The performance is below the upper bound from 2018, but better than a classifier system from 2017.	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, the paper is well structured and manages to show that RELIC is a versatile tool on which various tasks can be performed.	O	O	Review	386
The technical details are well covered and the evaluation is done in a detailed way.	O	O	Review	386
[line_break_token]The contribution of the paper is mostly in the definition of context-entity pairs as input to a transformer model and in empirical evaluations.	O	O	Review	386
I specifically found the findings in 5.3 interesting.	O	O	Review	386
The technological contribution is rather limited.	B-Review	B-1	Review	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor comments: At page 3, chapter 3.1 there is a word duplication [‚Ä¶]to correctly match match[‚Ä¶] that should be corrected.	B-Review	B-2	Review	386
Additionally, on page 5 it should be mentioned that the values in table 1 are precision values.	I-Review	I-2	Review	386
hank you for your thorough reading of the paper and detailed review.	O	O	Reply	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree that this paper's modelling contributions are simple, but we also feel that our empirical findings are the main contribution of this paper.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	386
These go much further than all previous efforts in testing the limits of entity embeddings learned from textual context.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As a point of clarification, we would like to point out that for the TriviaQA question answering task, RELIC is solving a much harder problem than the 2018 upper bound.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	386
RELIC has to retrieve the single correct answer from all 5m entities that have a Wikipedia page, whereas the 2018 upper bound is performing reading comprehension on a single document that is known to contain the answer (web setting).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We have updated the paper with a more recent and relevant comparison to "Latent Retrieval for Weakly Supervised Open Domain Question Answering" - Kenton Lee et.al.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	386

target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1612/).</a> Lee et.al.'s approach does still apply a reading comprehension model, but passages that are retrieved from Wikipedia rather than the document provided in TriviaQA's reading comprehension task.	O	O	Reply	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]RELIC's answer retrieval approach achieves 80% of the performance of Lee et.al's approach.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	386
We consider this significant, since Lee et.al.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	386
rely on an expensive BERT based co-encoding of the question and evidence text at inference time, while RELIC performs a simple nearest neighbour search over 5m pre-indexed answer candidates, which is vastly faster.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We believe that our results: that RELIC can reconstruct complex Wikipedia categories; and that RELIC can directly retrieve answers to trivia questions with 80% of the accuracy of Lee et.al's retrieve-then-read model, are significant and worthy of publication at ICLR despite the simplicity of the RELIC model.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	386
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We would also like to alert you to our modification of our entity linking experiments in response to questions from other reviewers.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	386
By simply reducing RELIC's search space to be more in line with other entity linking work, and adding extra document context to RELIC's text encoder, we have now matched the DeepType entity linking state of the art.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	386
DeepType relies on the large hand created Wikidata knowledge base for entity representations.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	386
The fact that RELIC can match DeepType's performance supports our central hypothesis that RELIC is managing to capture the type of knowledge that has previously been encoded by hand in structured knowledge bases.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	386
 We discuss these modifications fully in the response to all reviewers	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	386

This is a well-written and quite clear work about how a previous work on image compression using deep neural networks can be extended to train representations which are also valid for semantic understanding.	O	O	Review	405

At the point when the learning rate is lowered the validation accuracy increases rapidly, and our validation curves show these jumps clearly.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405

It is better to keep the sentences short and consistent:[line_break_token]E.g: subsection 3.2, page 5: ‚ÄúTo adapt the ResNet ‚Ä¶ where k is the number of ‚Ä¶ layers of the network‚Äù can be changed to 3 shorter sentences, which is easier to follow.	I-Review	I-5	Review	405
[line_break_token]There are some typos: e.g: part 3.1, fever ---> fewer, [line_break_token][line_break_token]- As it is mentioned in the paper, solving a Vision problem directly from a compressed image, is not a novel method (e.g: DCT coefficients were used for both vision and audio data to solve a task without any decompression).

[line_break_token][line_break_token]For specific points:[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding paper length: since this is a study paper, we felt it benefited from verbosity.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	405
However, we have managed to shorten the paper to 9.5 pages, while keeping the original story intact.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
We followed most of your suggestions: (1-2) We shortened the introduction and related work; (4) We made Section 4.3 (now Section 4.4) much more concise and moved Figure 4 to the appendix as it did not contain core results of our work. (	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
3) We added a better description of the compression metrics to the experiments section.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
However, we also moved the compression results to the appendix, and added a more detailed explanation of the metrics there. (	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
5) We also fixed wording in the paper as you suggested and moved hyperparameter settings and details to the appendix, as we felt these details distract from the main message of the paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
In addition to this, we refined presentation of joint training results using plots rather then presenting them in text.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As we mention in the paper, learning from DCT (of JPEG) has been done before.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	405
However, our setting of using features from learned compression networks is significantly different.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	405
The DCT of JPEG is simply a linear transform over 8x8 patches, whereas the compressed representation is a feature map from a deep convolutional neural network.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	405
This opens directions such as joint learning of compression and inference (see Section 6) and warrants a full study of the problem.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To show that the improvement of joint training generalizes to another task, we added an experiment: We take the (jointly trained) classification network and finetune it for segmentation.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	405
The results are shown in Figure 7, where the resulting network significantly outperforms the separately trained network - achieving a significant performance boost of 1.1-1.8% higher mIoU depending on the compression operating point.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
See Figure 7 and discussion in Section 6.2 of the revised paper for more details.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
[line_break_token]We emphasize that this generalization is also occurring across datasets, from ILSVRC2012 (classification) to PASCAL VOC (segmentation).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally, we made an effort to better clarify and describe the experiments	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	405

Neural-net based image compression is a field which is about to get hot, and this paper asks the obvious question: can we design a neural-net based image compression algorithm such that the features it produces are useful for classification & segmentation?	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The fact that it's an obvious question does not mean that it's a question that's worthless.	O	O	Review	405
In fact, I am glad someone asked this question and tried to answer it.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros:[line_break_token]- Clear presentation, easy to follow.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token]- Very interesting, but obvious, question is explored.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token]- The paper is very clear, and uses building blocks which have been analyzed before, which leaves the authors free to explore their interactions rather than each individual building block's property.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token]- Results are shown on two tasks (classification / segmentation) rather than just one (the obvious one would have been to only discuss results on classification), and relatively intuitive results are shown (i.e., more bits = better performance).	O	O	Review	405
What is perhaps not obvious is how much impact does doubling the bandwidth have (i.e., initially it means more, then later on it plateaus, but much earlier than expected).	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token]- Joint training of compression + other tasks.	O	O	Review	405
As far as I know this is the first paper to talk about this particular scenario.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token]- I like the fact that classical codecs were not completely discarded (there's a comparison with JPEG 2K).	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token]- The discussion section is of particular interest, discussing openly the pros/cons of the method (I wish more papers would be as straightforward as this one).	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons:[line_break_token]- I would have liked to have a discussion on the effect of the encoder network.	B-Review	B-1	Review	405
Only one architecture/variant was used.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
[line_break_token]- For PSNR, SSIM and MS-SSIM I would like a bit more clarity whether these were done channel-wise, or on the grayscale channel.	B-Review	B-2	Review	405
[line_break_token]- While runtime is given as pro, it would be nice for those not familiar with the methods to provide some runtime numbers (i.e., breakdown how much time does it take to encode and how much time does it take to classify or segment, but in seconds, not flops).	B-Review	B-3	Review	405
For example, Figure 6 could be augmented with actual runtime in seconds.	I-Review	I-3	Review	405
[line_break_token]- I wish the authors did a ctrl+F for "??"	B-Review	B-4	Review	405
and fixed all the occurrences.	I-Review	I-4	Review	405
[line_break_token]- One of the things that would be cool to add later on but I wished to have beeyn covered is whether it's possible to learn not only to compress, but also downscale.	B-Review	B-5	Review	405
In particular, the input to ResNet et al for classification is fixed sized, so the question is -- would it be possible to produced a compact representation to be used for classification given arbitrary image resolutions, and if yes, would it have any benefit?	I-Review	I-5	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]General comments:[line_break_token]- The classification bits are all open source, which is very good.	O	O	Review	405
However, there are very few neural net compression methods which are open sourced.	O	O	Review	405
Would you be inclined to open source the code for your implementation?	O	O	Review	405
It would be a great service to the community if yes (and I realize that it could already be open sourced -- feel free to not answer if it may lead to break anonymity, but please take this into consideration).	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token]	O	O	Review	405
Thank you for your positive feedback.	O	O	Reply	405
As for your comments, we have addressed them as follows:[line_break_token]1) The reason for not exploring more encoders is twofold.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	405
First, few of the state-of-the-art compression variants of neural networks are open-source which makes the implementation of different architectures very time consuming and difficult.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
We picked this particular encoder since it has been used in at least 2 different works, Theis et al and Agustsson et al Second, the autoencoder compression methods also all have a similar structure and thus one could expect the performance to be similar for different encoders.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
This is nevertheless an interesting direction of research worth pursuing.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
[line_break_token]2) These were done channel-wise (RGB).	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	405
[line_break_token]3) We have not yet had time to do this as the code for segmentation, classification and compression networks have different levels of optimization (e.g., NCHW vs NHWC tensor layout), so doing a fair comparison is time consuming and involves careful engineering.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	405
We however can do this before camera ready, if the paper is accepted.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
We also note that the architectures used for compression and inference are very similar, convolutional networks with residual blocks, and therefore FLOPs should be a good proxy metric.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
[line_break_token]4) This has been fixed in the revised edition of the paper[line_break_token]5) We agree that it would be interesting to learn the downscaling as well, after all it is just an anti-aliasing kernel (i.e. a convolution with a fixed kernel) followed by a subsampling operation and can be learned as well.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	405
 However, processing the images in full-resolution during training would quite significantly increase training times, which are already pushing our limits in terms of compute resources.	O	O	Reply	405
Another challenge is that hyperparameters of the ResNet architecture would likely need to be re-tuned.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	405
We chose to adhere to the standard setting of the classification literature, so that we could use the hyperparameter settings and training schedules which have already been optimized extensively	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	405

The paper is well organized with a clear idea of the proposed method and good related work descriptions.	O	O	Review	405
Overall, the descriptions are clear and easy to follow, but the experimental results need clarifying.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Regarding the multi-digit translation task, it is not straightforward to this reviewer how the proposed method could match the digits (semantic) with different colors (style) in different locations.	B-Review	B-1	Review	405
The description in the paper is not enough to explain the results in Fig.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
6.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
To this reviewer, this task is more complex than the street view translation one.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
In the same line, it is curious what the results would be if digits with different colors are overlapping at random location, rather than the grid-like arrangement.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405

Multi-digit translation.	O	O	Reply	405
[line_break_token]We added more explanation for the multi-digit translation experiment to the paper.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token](1) The MNIST-Multiple dataset is a controlled experiment, similar to MNIST-CD/CB [a], designed to verify our method's ability to disentangle content and style representations during I2I translation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
In particular, the content is represented by the different digits (0-9) and background classes, whereas style is represented by the shape and color variation added in digits as well as the (black or white) background colors.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
Our goal is to encourage the network to understand the semantic information, i.e. the different digits and backgrounds, when translating an image from domain A to domain B. That is, a successfully translated image should have the content of domain A, i.e. the digit class, and the style of domain B, i.e. the digit and background colors respectively.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token](2) We can achieve this by using the proposed EGSC-IT model.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
First, the feature mask sub-network (F_A in Fig.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
2) extracts the content information, i.e. the digit class, and provides it to the decoder.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
Second, the employed perceptual loss encourages the decoder to learn how to use this content information to do the translation while retaining semantic consistency.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
Finally, the AdaIN sub-network (F_B in Fig.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
2) translates the style information of each semantic class, i.e. the digit and background colors respectively, by using AdaIN, which has proven very successful in arbitrary style transfer tasks (see later responses for a further comment on this).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
We refer to the theoretical part of the paper where we provide a very detailed description of the translation procedure.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token](3) We agree with Reviewer 1 that this experiment is quite challenging, but we observe that our model can still obtain good results without the need for ground-truth semantic labels or paired data.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
For example, in Figure 6 top row the digits 1,2,3,4,6 can be successfully translated given the criteria described above.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
In street view translation the scenes in an image are generally more complex - i.e. the within class variation in the BDD dataset is much larger than that of the synthetic MNIST-Multiple dataset.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
We designed this experiment as a controlled, yet challenging, task to evaluate the different image-to-image translation methods.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
Given the lack of ground-truth translated images to compare to in our setting - due to the unsupervised nature of our problem - we believe this simplified experiment offers a more direct and intuitive way to evaluate the expected translations compared to e.g. street-view translation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token](4) The setting of different colors that overlap at random locations, as proposed by Reviewer 1, seems very interesting in theory.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
However, we believe that in practice it would be very difficult for any unsupervised translation method as there is too much ambiguity in the overlapped locations for a network to decide where to draw style cues from.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405

[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	O	O	Reply	405
Limitations.	O	O	Reply	405
[line_break_token]Since our method does not use any semantic segmentation labels nor paired data, there are still some artifacts in the generated images for some hard cases.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	405
This seems natural given the difficulty of the task.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
For example: (a) in street view translation, day->night and night->day (e.g. Fig.	O	O	Reply	405
7 bottom row) are more challenging than day->day (e.g. Fig.	O	O	Reply	405
7 top row).	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	405
As a result, it is sometimes hard for our model to understand the semantics in such cases.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
Even state-of-the-art fully-supervised semantic segmentation networks suffer in low light or adverse weather conditions. (	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
b) in face gender translation, our model can successfully translate the gender attribute while keeping the semantics, e.g. skin, hair and background color, consistent with the exemplar image.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
However, since we do not provide any semantic segmentation labels this results in some artifacts.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
This discussion about limitations will be added in the paper.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
In the future it would be interesting to extend our method to the semi-supervised setting in order to benefit from the presence of some fully-labeled data.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405

Style information propagation.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	405
[line_break_token]As already mentioned, the style information in our method is propagated by using the Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) technique [b]. This is a well-known technique in the style transfer field which has proven to be very successful for arbitrary style transfers, and has been adopted by many follow-up works.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
The idea behind AdaIN in our case is to align the mean and variance of the content feature channels coming from domain A (after applying the feature mask) with those of the style feature channels coming from domain B. According to [c], these feature statistics have been found to carry the style information in an image.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
Noise can also be used to generate images with diverse style [d], as proposed by Reviewer 2.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
However, our goal in this work is to allow users more explicit control over the translation process, which is something that noise-based approaches do not allow.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
In particular, noise inputs do not easily translate to intuitive style guidance, in contrast to our exemplar-guided approach, where we propose to use a sub-network (F_B in Fig.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
2) to explicitly extract the feature statistics from the exemplar image itself and - through AdaIN - adapt accordingly the source image.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
As a result, the user can match any desired style from the target domain just by picking the corresponding exemplar.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405

Latent space.	O	O	Reply	405
[line_break_token]With respect to the previous question, Reviewer 2 asks for a visualization of how the latent space changes given different exemplar images.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	405
Although generally a valid request, it does not apply to our case.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
Let us explain why.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
Due to the specifics of our architecture, the latent space is only associated with the content representation of an image, not the style of the exemplar.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
The latter is only added after the encoder part, i.e. the latent space, and the feature mask sub-network through the AdaIN sub-network (see Fig.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
2).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
As such, changing exemplars and visualizing the latent space would give the same point in the latent space if the source image (that provides the content) is the same.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
Alternatively, changing source images and visualizing the latent space is not informative about the translation procedure as the style is only added after the feature mask and AdaIN sub-networks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
In summary, the latent space is only related to the source image since the style information is only combined in the decoder part through feature mask and AdaIN techniques.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
Instead, to mimic what Reviewer 2 asked for, we added the male->female face translation results matrix in Fig.	O	O	Reply	405
9.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	405
We observe that the output image's content is consistent with the source image and its style is consistent with the target image.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
Such observation can reflect how the latent space changes given different source images as well as exemplars	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405

I enjoyed reading this manuscript.	O	O	Review	405
The paper is based on a simple idea used by others as well (i.e., the image has two components, one  that encode content which is shared across domains and another one characterizing the domain specific style).	O	O	Review	405
The other important idea is the use of feature masks that steer the translation process without requiring semantic labels.	O	O	Review	405
This is similar to attention models used by others but I think it is novel when applying to this specific application domain.	O	O	Review	405
I was a bit disappointed by the evaluation part.	B-Review	B-1	Review	405
The authors decided to perform ablation and to show the importance of each component using only the MNIST-Single dataset.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
While this is good as a toy example I would have expected to see such analysis on a more complex example, e.g., street-view translation.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405

Ablation study [line_break_token]In our paper, we present the ablation study on the MNIST-Single dataset because it is a more controlled setting where we can generate ground truth for comparisons.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	405
Furthermore, as mentioned in a previous answer, we believe that this simplified experiment offers a more direct and intuitive way to evaluate the expected translations compared to e.g. street-view translation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405

[line_break_token][line_break_token]I am leaning towards rejecting this paper because the experimental setup is not well justified and a few important details are missing before conclusions can be drawn.	O	O	Review	405

Depending on the authors‚Äô answers, I might be willing to adjust my rating.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token](1) Is there missing a delta in the first half of line 6 in Algorithm 1?	B-Review	B-1	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token](2) Throughout the experiments, for the same hyperparameter (e.g. Table 4 in A.2) do you run Algorithm 1 more than once and select the best sample architecture?	B-Review	B-2	Review	405
If the answer is yes, summarizing all masks as one parameter will not be reasonable.	I-Review	I-2	Review	405
Given a yes answer, I would also like to ask if the same number of samples have been considered for FC (for the same hyperparameter).	I-Review	I-2	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token](3) Is there any intuition behind why FC does a much worse job of fitting curves than ACN with much less parameters?	B-Review	B-3	Review	405
This refers to Fig.	I-Review	I-3	Review	405
2, if we compare FC with 41 parameters to ACN with 18 parameters.	I-Review	I-3	Review	405
I am confused because MSE on sampled points often goes down when we increase the number of parameters for the application of curve fitting.	I-Review	I-3	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token](4) Convolution can be thought of as a special case of ACN.	B-Review	B-4	Review	405
ConvNet is the default architecture for working on image datasets.	I-Review	I-4	Review	405
Since MNIST and CIFAR are considered, why not also compare to ConvNet?	I-Review	I-4	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token](5) The claims that ‚ÄúACNs achieve compression rates of up to three orders of magnitudes compared to fine-tuned fully-connected neural networks with only a fractional deterioration of classification accuracy‚Äù is quite misleading.	B-Review	B-5	Review	405
Given fully-connected neural networks achieve up to 528 times with also a fractional deterioration (Sec.	I-Review	I-5	Review	405
4.3), by presumably having a shallower architecture.	I-Review	I-5	Review	405
hank you for your time and the thorough evaluation of our paper.	O	O	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the following we want to clarify the points brought up in your review:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) There is no delta missing.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	405
Line 6 in Algorithm 1 is meant as 2 consecutive lines since we return the two sets m and delta at the end of the alogirthm.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
We will separate it to make it more clear.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
[line_break_token]However as you suggest it would also be possible to absorb the mask delta into m_i and only return m.[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) No, we do not select the best sample architecture.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	405
In the experiments we run Algorithm 1 only once per seed for 3 seeds and average the performance of all 3 resulting architectures.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	405
We do not apply any selection regarding the sampled architectures.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	405
All other models are also initialized, trained and evaluated over 3 different seeds and the results are averaged as well.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) To motivate the benefit of recursively repeating neurons, we would like to present an example from function composition.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	405
Let us consider a simple function which has only two parameters.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
By applying the composition we get a more complex function, but still having just two parameters.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
We can keep composing and achieve a very complex function, yet with only two parameters.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
Notice that the intuition of repeating neurons is equivalent to that of achieving a higher non-linear expressivity by composing functions, for instance composing a set of functions yields very deep representations, e.g.. Please consider that each can be a neuron, therefore our atomic networks are special cases of recursive function compositions from a set of base functions (a.k.a.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
repeating neurons in our paper).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
In our assessment, we are the first to consider adding non-linear expressivity by recursively applying the same set of neurons (a.k.a.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
functions).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Therefore ACN achieves much deeper architectures with the same number of parameters compared to a standard FCN, what could further improve the fitting capability.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
Finally we see the expected trend that the fit for both models increases respectively when increasing the number of parameters when going from left to right in both rows of figure 2.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4) The main focus of this work is showing the advantage of ACN compared to MLP baselines on vector data.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	405
The image datasets were added for experimental diversity as special case of high dimensional vector data (the images were flattened) with an explicit structure.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
In the same way as MLPs, ACNs are not able to levarage the spatial information in image data compared to a specialized architecture like ConvNets.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
Furthermore, although ConvNets share parameters of their filters over the image, they do not share parameters between layers.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
Since the extension of the underlying idea of our ACNs to ConvNets is not feasible within the short time of the rebuttal periode, we plan to explore that direction in future work.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]5) In our experiments we follow the established trend of comparing the compression rate w.r.t.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	405
a large standard model.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	405
However contrary to most work we also introduce a small, tuned FCN of comparable size to compressed networks, which is shown to be a very strong baseline [2].[line_break_token]In general our experiments confirm the findings of [1], that with a very large and comprehensive hyperparameter search including the general network architecture, one can find very shallow and small FC networks which perform on par or even better than most networks produced by compression techniques.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	405
The inherent advantage of the compression techniques is however that in most cases they lead more reliably and with less computational effort to relatively small and well performing architectures.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	405
[line_break_token]The 528 times is a typo in the text, it should be 218 times as reported in table 2.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	405

B-Reply	B-1	Reply	405
The proposed method works well compared to the other baselines because the special weight sharing architecture enables the model to use the available capacity given by the number of its parameters more efficiently.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
As we show in the experimental section this applies to randomly constructed networks, where the shared weights are trained end-to-end what leads to an effective fine-tuned collective network.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
However we want to emphasize that only the distribution and connections of the neurons are random, while the number of layers and number of neurons per layer is predefined.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
Furthermore as we point out in the conclusion, the proposed method could be combined with smarter approaches to construct even more powerful networks, e.g. by using  NAS methods (cp. [	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405

[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]&gt; ‚ÄûThe model size is small, but in what cases this small model size matters?‚Äú[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) The small model size achieved by the presented methods matters in different theoretical and real world scenarios.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	405

This paper explores the use of replicating neurons across and within layers to compress fully connected neural networks.	O	O	Review	405
The idea is simple, and is evaluated on a number of datasets and compared with fully connected, single layer, and several compression schemes.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Strengths: a lot of nice experiments with clearly advantageous results are given.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weaknesses: One obvious baseline missing is sparse compression, which can be achieved using either l1 regularization, or hard thresholding + fine tuning, both of which are easy to implement and appear in several works, e.g.[line_break_token][line_break_token]Scalable Neural Network Compression and Pruning Using Hard Clustering and L1 Regularization (Yang, Ruozzi, Gogate)[line_break_token]Training skinny deep neural networks with iterative hard thresholding methods (Yin, Yuan, Feng, Yan)[line_break_token][line_break_token]... many others just via googling ... [line_break_token][line_break_token]Also, I think this work should be compared with compression schemes that work via kronecker product, which seem very similar to this scheme (but where the kronecker matrix is binary to produce replication)[line_break_token][line_break_token]Compression of Fully-Connected Layer in Neural Network by Kronecker Product (Zhou, Wu)[line_break_token](more via google)[line_break_token][line_break_token]One obvious advantage of replication over kronecker product is lower complexity, but nonetheless, the methods belong in a similar family.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]After rebuttal: I have read the rebuttal and the authors have basically addressed all my concerns.	O	O	Review	405
It is a bit disappointing that simple L1 regularization can give competitive results, but the fact that the authors are willing to do the experiment and incorporate the results convinces me that there's nothing being hidden here, and the reader can make a fair and informed conclusion, so I have no more complaints.

This paper proposes a first step in the direction of 'real-world relevant RL approaches' in the sense of considering environments that don't halt their execution until an agent has finished its optimal action computation and execution but actually just go on being an environment.	O	O	Review	405
For this, the notion of a concurrent action is introduced.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper focuses on value-based RL approaches.	O	O	Review	405
It introduces modifications to the classical MDP formulation such that concurrent actions can be handled.	O	O	Review	405
From a theoretical perspective the resulting Bellman operators (for both continuous and discrete time) remain contractions and thus maintain q-learning convergence guarantees.	O	O	Review	405
Qlearning models are adopted to support concurrent actions and the experiments  demonstrate that the suggested enhancements are working well.	O	O	Review	405
e thank the reviewer for their positive review and an accurate summary of the paper	O	O	Reply	405

This paper considers the theoretically interesting and practically important problem of concurrent deep reinforcement learning (DRL), i.e., DRL in which the agent has to decide the next action while performing the previous one.	O	O	Review	405
This introduces several significant challenges, including delays/latency and interruption of an on-going action.	O	O	Review	405
To address this issue, this paper proposes to consider the continuous time formulation of the concurrent control problem, derive a continuous-time Bellman equation for the concurrent control scenarios, and then derive its discrete-time counterpart.	O	O	Review	405
Contraction properties are shown for both the continuous-time and discrete-time concurrent Bellman equations, and a value-based DRL algorithm based on the concurrent Bellman equations is proposed and tested on a few tasks.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The high level idea of this paper is very interesting and attractive, and in particular, the introduction of continuous-time reinforcement learning is novel.	O	O	Review	405
In addition, the numerical experiments do show that a consistently improved performance of the proposed approach on both synthetic and more real-world robotic control tasks.	O	O	Review	405
However, there are several significant issues about technical clarity or even correctness in this paper, which I elaborate below:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	405
The settings in sections 3.1 and 3.2 are not clear.	B-Review	B-1	Review	405
In particular, for 3.1, the author may want to specify the policy clearly, including whether it is stationary or non-stationary.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
And in addition, Q and V functions should either come with a \pi superscript, indicating which policy they use, or a \star superscript to indicate optimality.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
Section 3.2 does not make sense to me in general.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
It is not clear what the index i and the state value s_i(t) are.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
And it is not clear why we need to differentiate between values of states/actions and the functions themselves.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
The trajectory \tau is also not clearly defined.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
The authors need to make these much more clear, and should clearly state the main setting/model that the paper is considering (which seems to be the concurrent discrete-time case, but also not very clear to me).	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	405
The explanation of concurrent actions in continuous and discrete time is not clear.	B-Review	B-2	Review	405
In particular, Section 3.3 only speaks of the settings on a high level, and only brief explanations are given in Figure 1b and the beginning of Section 3.4.	I-Review	I-2	Review	405
Since the concurrent action setting is the central theme in this paper, I think a much more formal explanation should be given about how the system proceeds, instead of just a graphical example illustration.	I-Review	I-2	Review	405
In addition, the concurrent actions in discrete-time setting part is not even clearly mentioned (but is stated in the title of Section 3.3 and discussed subsequently).	I-Review	I-2	Review	405
The authors may also want to explain clearly what the episode is at the beginning of Section 3.4.	I-Review	I-2	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	B-Review	B-1	Review	405
The concurrent Bellman equation does not make much sense to me.	B-Review	B-3	Review	405
In particular, I think to define the optimal Q function, the bellman equation (7) and (9) should have a \max operator included.	I-Review	I-3	Review	405
Otherwise, it is only for policy evaluation.	I-Review	I-3	Review	405
Since the authors didn't clearly specify what the exact algorithm they are using (apart from a brief explanation by words in Section 3.5), I'm not sure whether I'm missing anything or not.	I-Review	I-3	Review	405
But the authors should definitely include a algorithm frame at least in the appendix, to clearly specify which of and how the concurrent Bellman equations are applied in their algorithm.	I-Review	I-3	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]So in sum, although I think the paper is interesting and novel on the high level, I don't think it's ready for publishing.	O	O	Review	405

We updated the manuscript to provide the details about the exact algorithm that was used in the experiments, which hopefully clarifies how the introduced method fits into a bigger robot-learning framework.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	405
We also added an algorithm frame in the Appendix that should allow readers to fully understand the contribution of this paper.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
We also applied the changes to the concurrent Bellman operator that include taking the maximum over actions.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405

The paper tackles the problem of making decisions for the next action while still engaged in doing the previous actions.	O	O	Review	405
Such a delay could either be part of the design (like a robot deciding the next action before its actors and motors have come to full rest after the current action) or an artefact of the delays inherent in the system (i.e. latency induced by calculations or latency of sensors).	O	O	Review	405
The paper shows how to model such delays within the Q-learning framework, show that their modelling preserves desirable contraction property of the Bellman update operator, and put their model into practice by an extensive set of experiments: learning policies for several simulated and a real-world setting.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors claim that that addition of this "delay" does not hinder the performance much of the RL method is given sufficient "context" about the delay, i.e., given extra features as input in order to learn to compensate for it.	O	O	Review	405
The writing of the paper is lucid and sufficient background is provided to make the paper self-sufficient in its explanations.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]However, there are some reasons which do not allow me to fully support the paper's acceptance.	O	O	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The changes made to the basic Q-learning setup, albeit novel and with desirable properties, in my opinion, are (i) theoretically relatively straight forward, (ii) are not expressive enough to capture the problem in its full generality (explained later), and (iii) need more empirical justification with problems where their modification is indeed indispensable.	B-Review	B-1	Review	405
The authors touch on several different research areas cursorily (viz.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
continuous reinforcement learning, Bellman contractions, feature engineering) while providing grounds for their idea, but in the end return to the familiar domain of discrete Q-learning with semi-hand-crafted (though theoretically motivated) features where the latency of actions can take a set of fixed values and the state is sampled at fixed intervals.	I-Review	I-1	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]If the actions are continuous, then could method from Doya (2000) directly be used to solve these problems?	B-Review	B-2	Review	405
Can the value-based models which he describes be augmented and extensions developed which build on Lemma 3.1 instead of the well-trodden ground of Lemma 3.2?	I-Review	I-2	Review	405
Especially, if one of the objectives which the authors claim their policies are better is "policy duration", then the absence of purely continuous policies is particularly egregious.	I-Review	I-2	Review	405
Further, reducing the policy duration seems like an independent objective which perhaps can be used for reward shaping for the traditional policy methods, which will also lead to different baselines.	I-Review	I-2	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors explicitly say that their method focuses on "optimizing for a specific latency regime as opposed to being robust to all of them;" and that they explicitly avoid learning forward models by including additional features.	B-Review	B-3	Review	405
However, the advantages of placing such restrictions on the design space are unclear at best.	I-Review	I-3	Review	405
Would it be the case that the high-dimensional methods will fail in this setting?	I-Review	I-3	Review	405
Are there theoretical advantages to working on limiting the attention to known latency regimes?	I-Review	I-3	Review	405
I suspect that the authors have concrete reasons for making these design decisions, but these do not come across in the paper in the writing, or by means of additional baselines.	I-Review	I-3	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As an example of a different approach towards the problem, which the authors overlook in their related work section, is that of learning with spiking neurons and point processes.	B-Review	B-4	Review	405
These areas of research have also been interested in problems of the "thinking while moving" nature: that of reinforcement learning in the context of neurons where the neurons act by means of spikes in response to the environment and other "spikes" [1, 2]. More recently, with point processes, methods have been developed to attain truly asynchronous action and state updates [3, 4]. A differently motivated work which ends up dealing with similar problems is in the direction of adaptive skip intervals [5], where the network also chooses the "latency" in the discrete sense.	I-Review	I-4	Review	405
Adding such related work would help better contextualize this paper.	I-Review	I-4	Review	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Some other ways the authors can improve the paper are (in no particular order):[line_break_token][line_break_token] - The description of the Vector-to-go is insufficient; some concrete examples will help.	B-Review	B-5	Review	405
[line_break_token] - The results of the simulated experiments are given in the form of distributions and it is very difficult to discern the effect of individual features in Figure 1.	I-Review	I-5	Review	405
Additionally, due to missing error bars, or other measures of uncertainty, the claim that the performance of models with and without the delayed-actions is comparable to the blocking setting seems tenuous at best, just looking at the rewards.	I-Review	I-5	Review	405
[line_break_token] - In particular, for the real experiments, we need more details about the experiment runs to determine why the performance of the policies in the real world is so vastly different.	I-Review	I-5	Review	405
Could the authors describe why the gap can be completely covered through simulations but not in the real world?	I-Review	I-5	Review	405

e thank the reviewer for their constructive feedback and exceptionally detailed review.	O	O	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree with the reviewer that although our theoretical justification is based on continuous-time RL and discusses a general framework for handling delays in Q-learning (continuous or discrete), our actual experiments return to the ‚Äúwell-trodden‚Äù regime of discrete-time RL with an auxiliary VTG input to the critic network.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	405
Regardless of whether the setting is continuous or discrete time RL, the problem of dealing with delays in RL persists.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
To the best of our knowledge, most of the SOTA DRL implementations are based on discrete-time RL formulations.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
We are not aware of any image-based DRL results that use a continuous-time RL formulation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
While that may be an interesting avenue, we believe this is outside of the scope of our work and believe our method to adapt discrete methods to handle delays is another way to approach the problem.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
We clarified this in Section 2.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree with the reviewer that since ‚Äúpolicy duration‚Äù is a quantitative metric that we use to support our claim of faster learned trajectories, a reasonable baseline method should incorporate this optimization goal.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	405
The baseline model we compare against penalizes slower policies that take more episode steps through reward discount gamma as well as an timestep penalty, a hyperparameter that returns a fixed negative reward every timestep.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	405
This timestep penalty was tuned through a hyperparameter search, and is described in further detail in the Appendix.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	405
Additionally, in Table 1 we add two baselines that do not utilize this reward penalty.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We also thank the reviewer for suggesting that we clarify the motivations behind restricting the design space.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	405
We focus our study on model-free methods because image-based model-based methods, such as video prediction models, are challenging to learn and an active area of research that is tangential to our main focus of studying concurrent environments.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
We limit our environments to known latency regimes because this is motivated by real-world robotics setups, where latencies can often be constrained within known upper bounds.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We appreciate the reviewer introducing additional related work and improvements that would help contextualize our contribution.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	405
These are exciting research directions that we think show much promise for when they are applied to vision-based robotic control tasks.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
We added a description of spiking neurons, point processes, and adaptive skip intervals in Section 2.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]"1.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
The description of the Vector-to-go is insufficient."	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
[line_break_token]Thank you for this suggestion.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
We have clarified the description of concurrent knowledge representations with a section in the appendix as well as with Figure 5.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]"2.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
The results of the simulated experiments are given in the form of distributions and it is very difficult to discern the effect of individual features in Figure 1.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
Additionally, due to missing error bars, or other measures of uncertainty, the claim that the performance of models with and without the delayed-actions is comparable to the blocking setting seems tenuous at best."	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
[line_break_token]We assume the reviewer is referring to Figure 2, not Figure 1, as our robotic grasping experiments do indeed report confidence intervals computed over multiple random seeds or real-world evaluations.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
Figure 2 is a hyperparameter sensitivity plot obtained by performing a hyperparameter tuning experiment across many training runs of the CartPole and Pendulum control tasks.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
The hyperparameter configurations are then sorted from best to worst, with the X axis plotting the sorted rank of the experiment.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
One can interpret the entire plot as a distribution over returns over N experiments, where shorter-tailed distributions imply that the method more ‚Äúrobust‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
Larger area-under-curve means that obtaining good performance is less sensitive to choice of hyperparameters (which is crucial for getting RL algorithms to work on real robots, where sample complexity is prohibitive).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Because this computationally expensive hyperparameter optimization procedure does not yield multiple i.i.d.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
experiments w.r.t a single hyperparameter configuration (for computational efficiency), we cannot estimate per-experiment uncertainty from this dataset as commonly done in RL.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]"3.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
Could the authors describe why the gap can be completely covered through simulations but not in the real world?"	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
[line_break_token]Thank you for this suggestion.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
To be completely frank, we are not sure exactly why the large-scale grasping success could be covered in the simulated but not in the real world.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
However, real-world robotic tasks are difficult and sensitive to many parameters.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
Given that, we still felt it important to report the full results.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
We also added more experiment details in the Appendix.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally, we would like to thank the reviewer for summarizing the main concerns.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405
We felt these insightful comments could be useful to other reviewers, and added our response to the general comment	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	405

1.	O	O	Review	20080
Summary[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors report on an empirical study of emergent behavior of multiple RL agents learning to play hide-and-seek (a sparse reward task).	O	O	Review	20080
The main point of this paper is that RL agents learning at scale (large number of samples, batch-size 64000).	O	O	Review	20080
can learn to solve tasks with strategies that are human-interpretable (e.g., using ramps, boxes).	O	O	Review	20080
Scale also requires various simplifications (e.g., keeping the learning setup as close as possible to a single-agent problem as possible).	O	O	Review	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Agents are grouped in 2 teams (seekers, hiders).	O	O	Review	20080
Each agent receives a team reward, e.g., it can be punished for events that it did not participate in, e.g., if a team-mate is seen by an opponent.	O	O	Review	20080
If hiders are hidden, seekers also automatically see reward.	O	O	Review	20080
The first 40% of the episode there is no reward to let hiders hide.	O	O	Review	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]There is one actor model, all agents share weights.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20080
Hence this is self-play: hiders and seekers use the same agent model.	I-Review	I-5	Review	20080
Also, all agents use a central value function that can see the entire state (decentralized execution, centralized learning).	B-Review	B-6	Review	20080
This makes the setting basically a single-agent problem, with the only decentralized aspect being each actor model only receiving its own observation.	I-Review	I-6	Review	20080
Note that a large body of multi-agent RL work in fact uses agents that do not share weights, etc.	I-Review	I-6	Review	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Other features described:[line_break_token]- Auto-curricula: e.g. agents find new strategies (using ramps, boxes) that other agents have to counteract.	B-Review	B-7	Review	20080
[line_break_token]- Human-relevant skills: They report that the agent model learns multiple ways to interact with (objects in) the environment that are semantically interesting (resembles something humans might do).	I-Review	I-7	Review	20080
[line_break_token]- Authors compare with policies learning via intrinsic motivation.	I-Review	I-7	Review	20080
[line_break_token]- Evaluation through transfer learning shows some benefit of transfer of hide-seek agents to auxiliary tasks.	I-Review	I-7	Review	20080
However, it is not so clear how this evaluation informs future work on transfer learning (e.g., how would you pick evaluation tasks for a given train-task?)	I-Review	I-7	Review	20080

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Reject.	O	O	Review	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The main point of the paper is empirical RL at scale.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20080
Although the learned behaviors are human-interpretable, this does not seem surprising given the fact that in many (large-scale) RL applications (Atari games, Go, DotA 2, Starcraft), it has been observed that RL agents can learn to manipulate and use their environment (which includes other agents!)	I-Review	I-1	Review	20080
in unexpected ways / find creative ways to exploit the reward function (see e.g. demos in <a href="https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html)."	O	O	Review	20080
target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html).</a> There has also been work on object-level RL [Agnew, Domingos 2018], which involves agents interacting with objects in the environment.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20080
Compared to this, the observation that RL agents learn human-interpretable uses of objects does not seem surprising.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper also does not give new insights in how to make large-scale RL ``'work'.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20080
For instance, there are no significant differences in algorithm / model structure from DotA / Starcraft agents that can inform future large-scale experiments.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper also does not introduce new concrete evaluation metrics that can apply to other tasks / RL problems, skill detection / segmentation methods to learn the structure of auto-curricula.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20080
Furthermore, the setup is very close to a single-agent problem (see above), and is far simpler in the multi-agent assumptions from other decentralized multi-agent work (Foerster 2018, Jacques 2019, etc).	I-Review	I-4	Review	20080
hank you for your review and constructive criticisms!	O	O	Reply	20080
We‚Äôll try to address each piece of criticism in turn.	O	O	Reply	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚Äî ‚ÄúThe main point of the paper is empirical RL at scale‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]The main point we hope to convey is that large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can lead to self-supervised autocurricula in which agents learn successively more complex human-relevant skills such as construction and tool use.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20080
We absolutely agree that there have been many amazing previous results from MARL at scale, and we acknowledge many of the works you mention and more in our introduction and related work sections.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20080
We believe our work differs from these in that our environment is built from very simple components in a physically grounded simulator, making it extremely extensible.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20080
It is much more clear how one could add to or modify the hide-and-seek environment to include more human-relevant components than it is how one could modify games like Go, Dota, or Starcraft.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚Äî ‚ÄúThere has also been work on object-level RL ‚Ä¶ the observation that RL agents learn human-interpretable uses of objects does not seem surprising.	O	O	Reply	20080
‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree that there has been much work on object-level RL.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20080
We didn‚Äôt advertise this as a novel portion of our work, and we‚Äôve already included many citations that use object-level architectures and attention at the end of Section 4.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20080
We also acknowledge that there have been prior works where RL learns human-interpretable uses of objects, which is why we include a paragraph in Section 2 on prior work in tool-use; however, our work can be distinguished from these and the work you cite in that we provide no explicit signal for interacting with objects; the pressure to interact with the objects is solely a result of multi-agent competition.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚Äî ‚ÄúThe paper also does not give new insights in how to make large-scale RL work‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper was not on how to make large-scale RL work, but rather on showing the power of current large-scale RL algorithms in a new setting that is more physically grounded and human-relevant than previous settings like DotA, Starcraft, and Go.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20080
The main argument of the paper is that multi-agent autocurricula can lead to agents learning many human-relevant skills like tool-use and construction; the fact that we required no new significant algorithmic modifications actually strengthens this point in our opinion, as the results can‚Äôt be confused as a pathology of a new specific algorithm.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20080
That being said, we agree that it is a great direction for future research to incorporate methods that can learn faster or better in this environment.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚Äî ‚ÄúThe paper also does not introduce new concrete evaluation metrics that can apply to other tasks / RL problems...‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]It‚Äôs very hard to create transfer tasks that are valid across domains.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	20080
However, we hope that the tasks we proposed can be used as transfer metrics for any future research within our domain (both of which we will open source).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚Äî ‚ÄúThere is one actor model, all agents share weights‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]Using shared weights, or at least some portion of training data coming from self-play, is very common (AlphaGo, DotA, Alphastar, Capture-the-Flag, NeuralMMO, etc.),	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	20080
and it doesn‚Äôt alter the multi-agent optimization objective.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	20080
Each agent still takes a greedy gradient and has its own observations and memory state so that at execution they use no privileged information.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	20080
Shared weights does not mean uni-brain (one brain many actions), which would indeed reduce this to a single agent problem.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	20080
That being said, we‚Äôve run the hide-and-seek experiment with separate weights for each agent and as expected have seen no difference in learned strategy.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚Äî ‚Äúall agents use a central value function that can see the entire state.	O	O	Reply	20080
This makes the setting basically a single-agent problem and is far simpler in the multi-agent assumptions from other decentralized multi-agent work‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]This is a commonly used method to reduce policy gradient variance in partially observed settings without letting agents cheat at execution time both for MARL (MADDPG, Counterfactual RL, AlphaStar) and also single agent RL (Dactyl, Asymmetric Actor Critic).	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	20080
We ablate this choice in the appendix and find that it is important at the given scale of compute but agents still learn without it.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As for other MARL algorithms, we cite both of the works you mention in our paper already, and it is an excellent line of future research to incorporate methods like these into setups such as hide-and-seek to see if they bring benefit to learning.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	20080
However, we don‚Äôt think algorithmic simplicity is a fault of our work but rather a strength.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	20080
We show that with only standard simple algorithms, multi-agent autocurricula can lead to human-relevant skills like construction and tool-use in physically grounded environments, which we believe provides a good baseline for future algorithmic research	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	20080

Authors in introduce a new competitive/cooperative physics-based environment in which different teams of agents compete in a visual concealment and search task with visibility-based team-based rewards (although There are no explicit incentives for agents to interact with objects in the environment).	O	O	Review	20080
They show that, complex behaviour emerge as the episode progresses and agents are able to learn 6 emergent skills/(counter-)strategies (including tool use), where agents intentionally change their environment to suit their needs.	O	O	Review	20080
Agents trained using self-play [line_break_token][line_break_token]In my opinion, this is an excellent paper which main contribution is to provide experimental evidence that relevant and complex skills and strategies can emerge from multi-agent RL competing scenarios.	O	O	Review	20080

[line_break_token][line_break_token]## Overall[line_break_token][line_break_token]**Summary**[line_break_token][line_break_token]The article introduces a new multi-agent physics environment called "hide-and-seek".	O	O	Review	20080
The authors trained agents in this environment and studied the emergence of and changes in strategies.	O	O	Review	20080
The authors also study the performance of these same agents in new "targeted intelligence tests" compared to training from scratch and compared to agents trained with curiosity.	O	O	Review	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]**Overall Opinion**[line_break_token][line_break_token]I think the environment is very appealing and the paper is overall well-structured and demonstrates novel work.	O	O	Review	20080
Therefore I'd recommend this paper to be accepted.	O	O	Review	20080
That being said, there are glaring issues with some of the writing that need to be addressed before I think this work conforms to the standards of ICLR.	O	O	Review	20080
However, if these issues are addressed, I have no issue increasing my review score.	O	O	Review	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Main problems:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The majority of the paper presents essentially a case study of what happened during a single seed of policy training.	B-Review	B-10	Review	20080
For RL literature that's very uncommon and I think it's consensus that DRL is very sensitive to random seeds.	I-Review	I-10	Review	20080
I know that you do have additional seeds in the appendix, but why didn't you mention those in the main body of the paper?	I-Review	I-10	Review	20080
You seem to have found some robustness against multiple seeds, so why not show it?	I-Review	I-10	Review	20080
And also the fact that Figure 1 &amp; 3 only apply to 1 seed is not mentioned.	O	O	Review	20080
I think this is easy enough to fix - I suggest since you're already at 10 pages, to just bring in the additional seeds from the appendix and average over their performance in Fig.1&amp;3.	O	O	Review	20080
[line_break_token]- The contributions section is overselling the work: (1) states that autocurricula lead to changes in agent strategy - Maybe I'm mistaken here but that sounds like a tautology.	B-Review	B-11	Review	20080
In other words, "a self-generated sequence of challenges" ("Autocurricula", according to [Leibo et al 2019][1]) lead to changes in strategy.	I-Review	I-11	Review	20080
And (3) advertises "a proposed framework for evaluating agents in open-ended environments" and also "a suite of targeted intelligence tests for our domain".	I-Review	I-11	Review	20080
The former of those two is either not in the paper or you mean your section "6.2 Transfer and Fine-Tuning as Evaluation", which isn't novel (see e.g. [Alain &amp; Bengio, 2016][2])[line_break_token]- Your acknowledgments should be anonymized until publication.	B-Review	B-12	Review	20080
Otherwise, reviewers might draw conclusions which group published this work, thus violating the double-blind review procedure.	I-Review	I-12	Review	20080

Here are some additional questions, comments, and nitpicks:[line_break_token][line_break_token]## Specific comments and questions[line_break_token][line_break_token]### Abstract[line_break_token][line_break_token]- "evidence that ... competition may scale better with increasing environment complexity" - that's only shown in the appendix[line_break_token][line_break_token]### Intro[line_break_token][line_break_token]- You mention TD-Gammon as a game, but I think it's an algorithm for the game Backgammon, similarly to how "Go" is the game and "AlphaGo" is an algorithm for playing.

Work[line_break_token][line_break_token]- all good[line_break_token][line_break_token]### Hide And Seek[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Arena boundaries: What's the penalty and what's " too far outside the play area"?	B-Review	B-15	Review	20080
And in all depictions, it looks like the geometry of the arena is elevated around the edges and the agents don't have a jump action, so how would they ever go out of borders?	I-Review	I-15	Review	20080
After watching the videos: Apparently, the jagged-looking arena boundary in the videos is purely cosmetic and agents can still access that space.	I-Review	I-15	Review	20080
This is unclear from just the paper and the renderings in Figure 1.	I-Review	I-15	Review	20080
[line_break_token][line_break_token]### Policy Optimization[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Policy network and fusion are underspecified: How do you deal with the varying number of agents, boxes, obstacles?	B-Review	B-9	Review	20080
Do you just set the x/v of the missing pieces to zero or is the observation actually of a different shape in case there are more/fewer objects or agents?	I-Review	I-9	Review	20080
How's the embedding done that is depicted in Figure 2?	I-Review	I-9	Review	20080

* Summary[line_break_token]This paper addresses machine reading tasks involving tracking the states of entities over text.	O	O	Review	407
To this end, it proposes constructing a knowledge graph using recurrent updates over the sentences of the text, and using the graph representation to condition a reading comprehension module.	O	O	Review	407
The paper reports positive evaluations on three different tasks.	O	O	Review	407
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Review[line_break_token][line_break_token]This is an interesting paper.	O	O	Review	407
The key technical component in the proposed approach is the idea that keeping track of entity states requires (soft) coreference between newly read entities and locations and the ones existing in the knowledge graph constructed so far.	O	O	Review	407
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The proposed method seems plausible, but some details are impressionistic and it is not clear why and whether the modeling choices do what the paper says.	B-Review	B-1	Review	407
This is especially the case in a few places involving coreference:[line_break_token]1.	I-Review	I-1	Review	407
The paper says at the top of page 6 that the result of Eq 1 is a disambiguated intermediate node representation.	I-Review	I-1	Review	407
[line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	407
The self attention in Eq 2 performs coreference disamguation which prevents different instances of the same location from being predicted for multiple entities.	B-Review	B-1	Review	407
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While these may indeed be working as advertised, it would be good to see some evaluation that verifies that after learning, what is actually happening is coreference.	B-Review	B-2	Review	407
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Why does the graph update require coreference pooling again?	B-Review	B-3	Review	407
 Don't the updates in Eq 1 and 2 take care of this?	I-Review	I-3	Review	407
The ablation does not test this, right?	I-Review	I-3	Review	407
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Another modeling choice that is not clear is regarding how the model processes the text -- reading prefixes of the paragraph, rather than one sentence at a time.	B-Review	B-4	Review	407
What happens if the model is changed to be read one sentence at a time?	I-Review	I-4	Review	407
[line_break_token][line_break_token]That the model implicitly learns constraints from data is interesting!	O	O	Review	407
[line_break_token]   [line_break_token]Bottomline: The paper presents interesting ideas and good results, but would be better if the modeling choices were better explored/motivated.	B-Review	B-1	Review	407

Thanks for the insightful comments.	O	O	Reply	407
We‚Äôve tried to improve our paper based on your feedback.	O	O	Reply	407
Most significantly, we‚Äôve performed additional ablation studies to confirm that our modeling choices improve performance, and we provide further empirical insight on what the coreference operations do.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	407

[line_break_token]======[line_break_token]Based on your comments, we‚Äôve performed additional ablations to measure the impact of the co-reference mechanisms.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	407
We find that removing any of them leads to a decrease in performance (Rows 2, 3, 4 of Table 5).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	407
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To provide more than just this quantitative insight, we‚Äôll expand here on how KG-MRC handles coreference to better motivate the modeling choices:[line_break_token]The construction of graph G_t from G_{t-1} uses co-reference disambiguation of nodes to prevent node duplication and to enforce temporal dependencies.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	407
We perform coreference disambiguation between location nodes of G_t and G_{t-1} via Eq.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	407
1 (call this inter-graph coreference) and between the location nodes in the same graph Gt (call this intra-graph coreference) via Eq.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	407
2.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	407
The inter-graph coreference yields new, intermediate representations for the nodes in G_t.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	407
These are further updated via the intra-graph coreference step.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	407
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Inter-graph Co-ref: One way to think about this is that we construct a new graph G_t at every time step.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	407
Now the graph G_{t-1} might contain some location nodes which are predicted again at time step ‚Äòt‚Äô (e.g., in Figure 2, leaf node already existed in G_{t-1}).	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	407
Instead of replacing an old node with an entirely new node at ‚Äòt‚Äô, we take a recurrent approach and do a gated update that preserves some information stored in the node in previous time steps while adding new information unique to time step ‚Äòt‚Äô.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	407
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Intra-graph Co-ref: Inter-graph co-ref isn‚Äôt enough since the MRC module makes its span predictions independently.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	407
This means that, at time step t, the model could predict the same span/location for multiple entities and add all these duplicates to the graph.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	407
Moreover, a single location might have the same surface form but be from different parts of the paragraph (e.g. ‚Äúleaf‚Äù in the 1st and the 5th sentence of the para in figure 2).	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	407
The operations in Eq.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	407
2 resolve this by performing self-attention (i.e., the predicted locations of all entities are compared to each other).	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	407
[line_break_token]====	O	O	Reply	407

The paper proposes a recurrent knowledge graph (bipartite graph between entities and location nodes) construction & updating mechanism for entity state tracking datasets such as (two) ProPara tasks and Recipes.	O	O	Review	407
The model goes through the following three steps: 1) it reads a sentence at each time step t and identifies the location of each entity via machine reading comprehension model such as DrQA (entities are predefined).	O	O	Review	407
2) Co-reference module adjusts relationship scores (soft adjacency matrix) among nodes, including possibly new nodes introduced by the MRC model.	O	O	Review	407
3) to propagate the relational information across all the nodes, the model performs L layers of LSTM for each entity that attend on other nodes via attention (where the weights come from the adjacency matrix).	O	O	Review	407
The model repeats the three steps for each sentence.	O	O	Review	407
The model is trained by directly supervising for the correct span by the MRC model at each time step, which is possible because the data provides strong supervision for each sentence (not just the answer at the end).	O	O	Review	407
[line_break_token] The model achieves the state of the art in the two tasks of ProPara and Recipes dataset.	O	O	Review	407
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Strengths: The paper provides an elegant solution for tracking relationship between entities as time (sentence) progresses.	O	O	Review	407
I also agree with the authors that this line of work (dynamic KG construction and modification) is an important area of research.	O	O	Review	407
While the model shares a similar spirit to EntNet, I think the model has enough distinctions / contributions, especially given that it outperforms EntNet by a large margin.	O	O	Review	407

*** Increased to Accept from Weak Accept after author rebuttal and changes to the paper ***[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper proposes a method, SNOW, for improving the speed of training and inference for transfer and lifelong learning.	O	O	Review	407
SNOW starts with a pre-trained, frozen source model, and trains delta models for target tasks which, at each layer, concatenate a small number of task-specific features with the top-K most useful subset of features in the corresponding layer in the source model.	O	O	Review	407
As long as the target tasks are sufficiently related to the source task, it allows for small delta models and a small additional parameter overhead in the form of one weight per source model feature map.	O	O	Review	407
While there are (i) some issues with the presentation of results for training efficiency, (ii) some question marks over the sensitivity of the model to hyper-parameters, and (iii) several grammatical errors / typos in the manuscript, if these can be addressed I recommend the paper for acceptance because it seems to strike a superior balance of efficiency (regarding memory usage and inference speed) and accuracy when compared to a number of baselines, and to my knowledge it is a novel approach.	B-Review	B-1	Review	407
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Detailed comments:[line_break_token]* Section 2.2 - How is sigma (the exploratory noise added for feature selection during training) chosen and how sensitive is the approach to its value?	B-Review	B-4	Review	407
It seems like it was fine-tuned, given that a different sigma is chosen for the Action dataset (several orders of magnitude difference).	I-Review	I-4	Review	407
In practice, tuning sigma could significantly increase training time.	I-Review	I-4	Review	407
[line_break_token]* It seems like the performance of only one run was plotted per hyperparameter setting - it would be informative to see a mean and standard deviation especially since the approach seems like it could be unstable for the wrong hyperparameter settings.	B-Review	B-5	Review	407
[line_break_token]* Related to the previous point, how much do the top-K feature selections change throughout training?	B-Review	B-6	Review	407
One would have thought that this could cause instability during training for a high sigma.	I-Review	I-6	Review	407
If sigma is too low, you could end up with suboptimal feature selection.	I-Review	I-6	Review	407
[line_break_token]* Figure 4 graphs are a bit misleading because the throughput on the x-axis is reported per GPU and the larger models all need 2 or more GPUs.	B-Review	B-7	Review	407
While this is mentioned in the main text, it is still optically deceptive and the results are GPU-dependent - presumably if the GPUs had a larger memory, the larger models would not seems as slow.	I-Review	I-7	Review	407
I think it would be clearer to plot images/sec on the x-axis or to rerun the experiments just using a single GPU.	I-Review	I-7	Review	407
[line_break_token]* It is stated that  ‚Äú[d]etermining K [‚Ä¶] has a critical impact on both size and target accuracy in the target models‚Äù, where K is the number of feature maps in the source model that the delta model subscribes to in each layer.	B-Review	B-8	Review	407
How sensitive is the accuracy exactly?	I-Review	I-8	Review	407
Can this be quantified or discussed in more detail?	I-Review	I-8	Review	407
[line_break_token]* Furthermore, how sensitive is the performance to the number of target-model-specific features at each layer?	B-Review	B-9	Review	407
[line_break_token]* Different learning rate schedules were used for SNOW and baselines - initial lr for SNOW is 1.0, while for all other models it is 0.1.	B-Review	B-10	Review	407
Was it checked whether the baselines improve when they are run with an initial lr of 1.0?	I-Review	I-10	Review	407
Was this hyperparameter more heavily tuned for SNOW than for the baselines?	I-Review	I-10	Review	407
[line_break_token]* Since the source model is fixed, the applicability of the approach to lifelong learning is heavily dependent on the usefulness of the source model to subsequent tasks.	B-Review	B-11	Review	407
If it is not, then one will have to incorporate large delta models.	I-Review	I-11	Review	407
Furthermore, there can be no transfer between the tasks trained in the delta models.	I-Review	I-11	Review	407

[tab_token]I do not think that the model proposed in this paper is able to tackle lifelong learning problem.	B-Review	B-1	Review	407
The main reason is that lifelong learning basically requires only one model that will continue to learn from new tasks.	I-Review	I-1	Review	407
After learning several new tasks, people hope this model can still perform well on the previous tasks as well as the current ones.	I-Review	I-1	Review	407
However, in this paper, not only one model is learned.	I-Review	I-1	Review	407
Instead, new models appear when new tasks are given, which does not meet the definition or requirement of lifelong learning.	I-Review	I-1	Review	407
It only meets the requirement of transfer learning.	I-Review	I-1	Review	407
The experimental results also validate my opinion since only one new task is given while in lifelong learning, continuous new tasks will come and the original model should perform well on all of them as well as on the old tasks.	I-Review	I-1	Review	407

One might assume that SNOW consists of multiple models as it has the source model and the ‚Äúdelta‚Äù models.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	407
But, the term ‚Äúdelta model‚Äù is used for an easier explanation about the expanded parts in the SNOW architecture.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	407
We argue that the entire architecture based on SNOW can be regarded as a single model (which just consists of various modules to deliver multi-task predictions) because a delta model alone is not semantically sufficient for an intended task when there already exists transferability from the source task to the target task.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	407
In fact, the delta and source models must efficiently cooperate as a single-engine to perform target tasks effectively (which is the key difference from a collection of models such as ensemble learning), which is the main contribution in this work.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	407

This paper studies the problem of identifying (discovering) synonymous entities.	O	O	Review	900
The paper proposes using the "contexts" of the entities as they occur in associated text corpora (e.g. Wiki) in the proposed neural-network based embedding approach for this task.	O	O	Review	900
The key novelties of the approach lie in the "matching" system used, where contexts of one entity are matched with that for the other entity to see how well they align with each other (which effectively determines the similarity of the two entities).	O	O	Review	900
Experiments are conducted on three different datasets to show the efficacy of the proposed approach.	O	O	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall I found the paper to be an interesting read with some nice ideas mixed in.	O	O	Review	900
However I also had some concerns which are highlighted later down below, which I believe if addressed would lead to a very strong work.	O	O	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Quality: Above average[line_break_token][line_break_token]In general the method seems to work somewhat better than the baselines and the method does have a couple of interesting ideas.	O	O	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Clarity: Average[line_break_token][line_break_token]I found a few key details to be missing and also felt the paper could have been better written.	B-Review	B-6	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Originality: Average[line_break_token][line_break_token]The matching approach and use of the leaky units was interesting tidbits.	O	O	Review	900
Outside of that the work is largely about the application of such Siamese RNNs based networks to this specific problem. (	O	O	Review	900
The use of context of entities has already been looked at in previous works albeit in a slightly more limited manner)[line_break_token][line_break_token]Significance: Slightly below average[line_break_token][line_break_token]I am not entirely sold on the use of this approach for this problem given its complexity and unclear empirical gains vs more sophisticated baselines.	B-Review	B-7	Review	900
The matching aspect may have some use in other problems but nothing immediately jumps out as an obvious application.	I-Review	I-7	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]----[line_break_token][line_break_token]Strengths / Things I liked about the paper:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- In general the method is fairly intuitive and simple to follow which I liked.	O	O	Review	900
[line_break_token]- The matching approach was an interesting touch.	O	O	Review	900
[line_break_token]- Similarly for the "leaky" unit.	O	O	Review	900
[line_break_token]- Experiments conducted on multiple datasets.	O	O	Review	900
[line_break_token]- The results indicate improvements over the baselines considered on all the three datasets.	O	O	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weaknesses / Things that concerned me:[line_break_token][line_break_token]-  (W1) Slightly unfair baselines?	B-Review	B-1	Review	900
One of the first things that struck me in the experimental results was how competitive word2vec by itself was across all three datasets.	I-Review	I-1	Review	900
This made me wonder what would happen if we were to use a more powerful embedding approach say FastText, Elmo, Cove or the recently proposed BERT? (	I-Review	I-1	Review	900
The proposed method itself uses bidirectional LSTMs)[line_break_token][line_break_token]Furthermore all of them are equally capable of capturing the contexts as well.	I-Review	I-1	Review	900
An even more competitive (and fair) set of baselines could have taken the contexts as well and use their embeddings as well.	I-Review	I-1	Review	900
Currently the word2vec baseline is only using the embedding of the entity (text), whereas the proposed approach is also provided the different contexts at inference time.	I-Review	I-1	Review	900
The paper says using the semantic structure and the diverse contexts are weaknesses of approaches using the contexts, but I don't see any method that uses the context in an embedding manner -- say the Cove context vectors.	I-Review	I-1	Review	900
If the claim is that they won't add any additional value above what is already captured by the entity it would be good to empirically demonstrate this.	I-Review	I-1	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- (W2) Significance testing: On the topic of experimentation, I was concerned that significance testing / error estimates weren't provided for the main emprical results.	B-Review	B-2	Review	900
The performance gaps seem to be quite small and to me it is unclear how significant these gaps are.	I-Review	I-2	Review	900
Given how important significance testing is as an empirical practice this seems like a notable oversight which I would urge the authors to address.	I-Review	I-2	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- (W3) Missing key details: There were some key aspects of the work that I thought were not detailed.	B-Review	B-3	Review	900
Chief among these was the selection of the contexts for the entities.	I-Review	I-3	Review	900
How was this?	I-Review	I-3	Review	900
How were the 20 contexts identified?	I-Review	I-3	Review	900
Some of these entities are likely far more common than just 20 sentences and hence I wonder how these were selected?	I-Review	I-3	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Another key aspect I did not see addressed: How were the entities identified in the text (to be able to find the contexts for them)?	I-Review	I-3	Review	900
The paper claims that they would like to learn from minimal human annotations but I don't understand how these entity annotations in the text were obtained.	I-Review	I-3	Review	900
This again seems like a notable oversight.	I-Review	I-3	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- (W4) Concerns about the method: I had two major concerns about the method: [line_break_token][line_break_token](a) Complexity of method :  I don't see an analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method (which scales quadratically with P the number of contexts); [line_break_token][line_break_token](b) Effect of redundant "informative" contexts: Imagine you have a number of highly informative contexts for an entity but they are all very similar to each other.	B-Review	B-4	Review	900
Due to the way the matching scores are aggregated, these scores are made to sum to 1 and hence no individual score would be very high.	I-Review	I-4	Review	900
Given that this is the final coefficient for the associated context, this seems like a significant issue right?	I-Review	I-4	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Unless the contexts are selected to be maximally diverse, it seems like this can essentially end up hurting an entity which occurs in similar contexts repeatedly.	I-Review	I-4	Review	900
I would like to see have seen the rationale for this better explained.	I-Review	I-4	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token](c) A smaller concern was understanding the reasoning behind the different loss functions in the siamese loss function with a different loss for the positive and the negative, one using a margin and one which doesn't.	I-Review	I-4	Review	900
One which scales to 1/4, the other scaling to (1-m)^2.	I-Review	I-4	Review	900
This seems pretty arbitrary and I'd like to understand this.	I-Review	I-4	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-(W5) Eval setting : My last concern was with the overall evaluation setup.	B-Review	B-5	Review	900
Knowledge bases like Freebase are optimized for precision rather than recall, which is why "discovery" of new relations is important.	I-Review	I-5	Review	900
However if you treat all missing relationships as negative examples then how exactly are you measuring the true ability of a method?	I-Review	I-5	Review	900
Thus overall I'm pretty skeptical about all the given numbers simply because we know the KBs are incomplete, but are penalizing methods that may potentially discover relations not in the KB.	I-Review	I-5	Review	900
We thank the reviewer for the thorough review and constructive feedback.	O	O	Reply	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We first would like to thank the reviewer for the positive feedback on our work.	O	O	Reply	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For the part that concerned the reviewer, we elaborate point by point as shown below:[line_break_token][line_break_token](W1) For the experiment setting, the proposed model can work with various word embeddings.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	900
The contribution of our work does not lie in the choice of word embeddings, but the proposed architecture that utilizes entity representations for bilateral matching among multiple pieces of contexts.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	900
Our model is independent of the choice of word embeddings, and we adopt Word2vec as a base case.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	900
We aim to experiment the modeling ability of different model architectures given the same word representation information for synonym discovery.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	900
With sophisticated word embedding methods such as Elmo or BERT, which achieve decent performances on various NLP tasks, we do expect that both baselines and our model will get better performance.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token](W2) We‚Äôve added the significance testing in the experiment and update Table 2 with discussions.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	900
A single-tailed t-test is performed to see whether or not the proposed model can outperform other baselines with significant improvements.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token](W3) For the missing key details, the contexts are randomly selected from all contexts in which each entity is mentioned.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	900
Due to limitations on computing resources, we are only able to verify the performance of up to 20 pieces of randomly chosen contexts in which each entity is mentioned.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	900
For Wiki+Freebase and PubMed+UMLS, the datasets come with entity mentions annotated.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	900
While in MedBook+MKG, we apply existing NER model [1] with contextualized embeddings [2] to obtain the annotated entities from the text.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	900
We clarified the claim about the annotation: the proposed model does not require additional structured annotations on the free-text corpus, such as entity ontologies, dependency parsing results during training and inference.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	900
The inference stage for synonym discovery is also designed to be data-driven so that we do not need pre-specified candidate entity pairs prepared by domain experts to be verified by the model, which further alleviates annotation efforts.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	900
We added these details in the revised version	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	900

The paper presents a neural network model (SYNONYMNET) for automatically discovering synonymous entities from a large free-text corpus with minimal human annotation.	O	O	Review	900
The solution is fairly natural in the form of a siamese network, a class of neural network architectures that contain two or more identical subnetworks, which are an obvious approach for such a task, even though this task's SotA does not cover such architectures.	O	O	Review	900
even though the abstract consists the word novel, the chosen architecture is not a novel one but attached to this task, it can be considered as if.	O	O	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]# Paper discussion:[line_break_token][line_break_token]The introduction and the related work are well explained and the article is well structured.	O	O	Review	900
The authors mark very well the utility of automatically discovering synonyms.	O	O	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Section 2 presents the SynonymNet, mainly the bi-LSTM applied on the contexts and the bilateral matching with leaky unit and the context aggregation for each entity, along with training objectives and the inference phase.	O	O	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The novelty does not consist in the model since the model derives basically from a siamese network, but more in the approach, mainly the bilateral matching: one input is a context for an entity, the other input is a context for the synonym entity, and the output is the consensus information from multiple pieces of contexts via a bilateral matching schema with leaky unit (highest matched score with its counterpart as the relative informativeness score) and the context aggregation.	O	O	Review	900
The inference phase is a natural step afterward.	O	O	Review	900
Also, the usage of the leaky unit is clearly stated.	O	O	Review	900
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Section 3 presents the experimental phase, which is correct.	O	O	Review	900
The choice of LSTMs is understandable but other experiments could have been done in order to make clearer why it has been chosen.	O	O	Review	900
Regarding also the word embeddings choice, other experiments could have been completed (word2vec and GloVe have been competing with many other embeddings recently).	O	O	Review	900

The comparison should also include as baselines the very relevant methods listed in the last paragraph of the related work section (Snow et a.l 2005, Sun and Grishman 2010, Liao et al 2017, Cambria et al 2018).	I-Review	I-1	Review	900
[line_break_token]-- (b) unclear dataset selection: it is not clear which datasets are collected by the authors and which are pre-existing datasets that have been used in other work too.	I-Review	I-1	Review	900
It is not clear if the datasets that are indeed collected by the authors are publicly available.	I-Review	I-1	Review	900
Furthermore, no justification is given as to why well-known publicly available datasets for this task are not used (such as CoNLL-YAGO (Hoffart et al 2011), ACE 2004 (NIST, 2004; Ratinov et al 2011), ACE 2005 (NIST, 2005; Bentivogli et al 2010), and Wikipedia (Ratinov et al 2011)).	I-Review	I-1	Review	900
[line_break_token]- the coverage of prior work ignores the relevant work of Gupta et al 2017 EMNLP.	B-Review	B-2	Review	900
This should also be included as a baseline.	I-Review	I-2	Review	900
[line_break_token]- Section 2 criticises Mikolov et al's skip-gram model on the grounds that it introduces noisy entities because it ignores context structure.	B-Review	B-3	Review	900
Yet, the skip-gram model is used in the preprocessing step (Section 3.1).	I-Review	I-3	Review	900
This is contradictory and should be discussed.	I-Review	I-3	Review	900
[line_break_token]- the definition of synonyms as entities that are interchangeable under certain contexts is well known and well understood and does not require a reference.	B-Review	B-4	Review	900

Summary: This paper proposes a technique for quantizing the weights and activations of a CNN.	O	O	Review	1142
The main contribution is in replacing the heuristic to find good quantization intervals of (Zhu et al, 2016) with a different heuristic based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm, and empirically validating its effectiveness.	O	O	Review	1142
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Strenghts:[line_break_token]- The proposed nested-means heuristic is simple and makes sense intuitively.	O	O	Review	1142
[line_break_token]- The experiments on two modern architectures seem solid and demonstrate good empirical performance.	O	O	Review	1142
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weaknesses:[line_break_token]- The main weakness is the limited novelty of this paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	1142
The proposed setup is almost identical to the one in (Zhu et al, 2016), except for the replacement of the heuristic to find quantization intervals with another one.	I-Review	I-1	Review	1142
While the experiments demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the method as a whole, what is missing is a direct, controlled comparison between the original heuristic and the proposed one.	I-Review	I-1	Review	1142
Now it is hard to tell whether the accuracy increases are obtained through the proposed adaptation or because of other factors such as a better implementation or longer training.	I-Review	I-1	Review	1142
[line_break_token]- In section 4, it is not made clear whether the activations are quantized according to the same scheme as the weights (apart from the issue of selecting a good clipping interval, which is addressed).	B-Review	B-2	Review	1142
[line_break_token]- The paper is a bit short on references, considering the many recent works on quantized neural networks.	B-Review	B-3	Review	1142
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor comments and questions:[line_break_token]- The wording is sometimes imprecise, making some arguments hard to follow.	B-Review	B-4	Review	1142
Two examples:[line_break_token]-- "Lowering the learning rate for re-training can diminish heavy changes in the weight distribution, at the cost of longer time to converge and the risk to get stuck at plateau regions, which is especially critical for trainable scaling factors"[line_break_token]-- "This approach is beneficial because it defines cluster thresholds which are influenced by large weights that were shown to play a more important role than smaller weights (Han et al 2015b)"[line_break_token]- The title says "for compression and inference acceleration", so it would be nice if the paper reports some compression and timing metrics in the experiments section.	I-Review	I-4	Review	1142
[line_break_token]- The notation in section 3.1 overly complicated, could probably be simplified a bit for readability.	B-Review	B-6	Review	1142
[line_break_token]- Section 3.3: "However, having an additional hyperparameter t_i for each scaling factor alpha_i renders the mandatory hyperparameter tuning infeasible." -	B-Review	B-7	Review	1142
> From section 4.2 in (Zhu et al, 2016), I believe the constant factor t is shared across all layers, making it only a single hyperparameter.	O	O	Review	1142
[line_break_token]- Last paragraph of section 4: "(Cai et al 2017) experimentally showed that the pre-activation distribution after batch normalization are all close to a Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance.	B-Review	B-8	Review	1142
Therefore, we propose to select a fixed clipping parameter gamma.". -	I-Review	I-8	Review	1142
> But what about the activations *before* the batchnorm layer where the assumption of zero mean and unit variance does not hold?	O	O	Review	1142
Many thanks for the detailed feedback, which helped us to (hopefully) improve the revised version of the paper[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Novelty: the difference you point out to (Zhu et al, 2016) is correct, we adopted the gradient-based scaling factors.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	1142

As a result, we achieve 2.6% better Top1 accuracy (Inception on ImageNet) for the ternary (2-bit encoding) representation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1142
The configurable quantization levels enables the quaternary (2-bit encoding) representation which achieves 3.8% better Top1 accuracy without increasing quantization footprint. (	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1142

This paper is about CNN model compression and inference acceleration using quantization.	O	O	Review	1142
The main idea is to use 'nest' clustering for weight quantization, more specifically, it partitions the weight values by recurring partitioning the weights by arithmetic means and negative of that of that weight clustering.	O	O	Review	1142
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I have several questions for this paper:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) the main algorithm is mainly based on the hypothesis that the weights are with Gaussian distribution.	B-Review	B-1	Review	1142
What happens if the weights are not Gaussian, such as skewed distribution?	I-Review	I-1	Review	1142
Seems the outliners will bring lots of issues for this nest clustering  for partitioning the weight values.	I-Review	I-1	Review	1142
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) Since the paper is on inference acceleration, there is no real inference time result.	B-Review	B-2	Review	1142
I think having some real inference time on these quantized models and showing how their inference time speedup is will be interesting.	I-Review	I-2	Review	1142
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) Activation quantization in Section 4 is a standard way for quantization, but I am curious how to filter out the outliner, and how to set the clipping interval?	B-Review	B-3	Review	1142
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4) I am not sure what does the 'sparsity' mean in Table 2?	B-Review	B-4	Review	1142
Does this quantization scheme introduce many zeros?	I-Review	I-4	Review	1142
Or sparsity is corresponding to the compression ratio?	I-Review	I-4	Review	1142
If that is the case, then many quantization algorithms can actually achieve better compression ratios with 2 bits quantization.	I-Review	I-4	Review	1142

Regarding your questions:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Reply	1142
 Gaussian distribution: We observe that l2-regularized weights are close to a zero-mean Gaussian, but actually we only assume that weights are symmetrically distributed around zero (the assumption is only used in nested-means clustering for the initial split at zero).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	1142
That is, our clustering is also compatible with non-Gaussian distributions and we rephrased our text to be clearer in this regard.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	1142

[line_break_token]========[line_break_token]Summary[line_break_token]========[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper deals with the training of neural networks for classification or sequence generation tasks, using a cross-entropy loss.	O	O	Review	353
Minimizing the cross-entropy means maximizing the predicted probabilities of the ground-truth classes (averaged over the samples).	O	O	Review	353
The authors introduce a "complementary entropy" loss with the goal of minimizing the predicted probabilities of the complementary (incorrect) classes.	O	O	Review	353
To do that, they use the average of sample-wise entropy over the complement classes.	O	O	Review	353
By maximizing this entropy, the predicted complementary probabilities are encouraged to be equal and therefore, the authors claim that it neutralizes them as the number of classes grows large.	O	O	Review	353
The proposed training procedure, named COT, consists of alternating between the optimization of the two losses.	O	O	Review	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The procedure is tested on image classification tasks with different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Street View House Numbers, Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet), machine translation (training using IWSLT dataset, validation and test using TED tst2012/2013 datasets), and speech recognition (Gooogle Commands dataset).	O	O	Review	353
In the experiments, COT outperforms state-of-the-art models for each task/dataset.	O	O	Review	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Adversarial attacks are also considered for the classification of images of CIFAR-10: using the Fast Gradient Sign and Basic Iterative Fast Gradient Sign methods on different models, adversarial examples specifically designed for each model, are generated.	O	O	Review	353
Then results of these models are compared to COT on these examples.	O	O	Review	353
The authors admit[line_break_token]that the results are biased since the adversarial attacks only target part of the COT objective, hence more accurate comparisons should be done in future work.	B-Review	B-5	Review	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token]===========================[line_break_token] Main comments and questions[line_break_token]===========================[line_break_token][line_break_token]End of page 1: "the model behavior for classes other than the ground  truth stays unharnessed and not well-defined".	B-Review	B-1	Review	353
The probabilities  should still sum up to 1, so if the ground truth one is maximized,  the others are actually implicitly minimized.	I-Review	I-1	Review	353
No?	I-Review	I-1	Review	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Page 3, sec 2.1: "optimizing on the complement entropy drives ≈∑_ij to 1/(K ‚àí 1)".	B-Review	B-2	Review	353
I believe that it drives each term ≈∑_ij /(1 ‚àí ≈∑_ig ) to be equal to 1/(K-1).	I-Review	I-2	Review	353
Therefore, it drives ≈∑_ij to (1 ‚àí ≈∑_ig)/(K-1) for j!=g.	I-Review	I-2	Review	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This indeed flattens the ≈∑_ij for j!=g, but the effect on ≈∑_ig is not controlled.	I-Review	I-2	Review	353
In particular this latter can decrease.	I-Review	I-2	Review	353
Then in the next step of the algorithm, ≈∑_ig will be maximized, but with no explicit control over the complementary probabilities.	I-Review	I-2	Review	353
There are two objectives that are optimized over the same variable theta.	I-Review	I-2	Review	353
So the question is, are we sure that this procedure will converge?	I-Review	I-2	Review	353
What prevents situations where the probabilities will alternate between two values?	I-Review	I-2	Review	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For example, with 4 classes, we look at the predicted probabilities of a given sample of class 1:[line_break_token]Suppose after step 1 of Algo 1, the predicted probabilities are:  0.5 0.3 0.1 0.1 [line_break_token]After step 2:  0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3[line_break_token]Then step 1: 0.5 0.3 0.1 0.1[line_break_token]Then step 2: 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3[line_break_token]And so on... Can this happen?	I-Review	I-2	Review	353
Or why not?	I-Review	I-2	Review	353
Did the algorithm have trouble converging in any of the experiments?	I-Review	I-2	Review	353

If it is the learning rate, why not use a different one, tuned for each objective?	I-Review	I-3	Review	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Sec 3.2:[line_break_token]The additional optimization makes each training iteration more costly.	B-Review	B-4	Review	353
How much more?	I-Review	I-4	Review	353
How do the total running times of COT compare to the ones of the baselines?	I-Review	I-4	Review	353
I think this should be mentioned in the paper.	I-Review	I-4	Review	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Sec 3.4:[line_break_token]As the authors mention, the results are biased and so the comparison is not fair here.	B-Review	B-5	Review	353
Therefore I wonder about the  relevance of this section.	I-Review	I-5	Review	353
Isn't there an easy way to adapt the attacks to the two objectives to be able to illustrate the conjectured robustness of COT?	I-Review	I-5	Review	353
For example, naively having a two steps perturbation of the input: one based on the gradient of the primary objective and then perturb the result using the gradient of the complementary objective?	I-Review	I-5	Review	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token]===========================[line_break_token]Secondary comments and typos[line_break_token]===========================[line_break_token][line_break_token]Page 3, sec 2.1: "...the proposed COT also optimizes the complement objective for neutralizing the predicted probabilities...", using maximizes instead of optimizes would be clearer.	B-Review	B-6	Review	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the definition of the complement entropy, equation (2), C takes as parameter only y^hat_Cbar but then in the formula, ≈∑_ig appears.	B-Review	B-7	Review	353

The probabilities should still sum up to 1, so if the ground truth one is maximized,  the others are actually implicitly minimized.	O	O	Reply	353
No?	O	O	Reply	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token](A1) Your understanding is totally correct.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	353
We have changed the original text to a more clear statement:[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚ÄúTherefore, for classes other than the ground truth, the model behavior is not explicitly optimized --- their predicted probabilities are indirectly minimized when ≈∑_ig is maximized since the probabilities sum up to 1.‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]We want to thank the reviewer again for crystalizing the manuscript.

[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token](Q2) Page 3, sec 2.1: "optimizing on the complement entropy drives ≈∑_ij to 1/(K ‚àí 1)".	O	O	Reply	353
I believe that it drives each term ≈∑_ij /(1 ‚àí ≈∑_ig ) to be equal to 1/(K-1).	O	O	Reply	353
Therefore, it drives ≈∑_ij to (1 ‚àí ≈∑_ig)/(K-1) for j!=g.	O	O	Reply	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This indeed flattens the ≈∑_ij for j!=g, but the effect on ≈∑_ig is not controlled.	O	O	Reply	353
In particular this latter can decrease.	O	O	Reply	353
Then in the next step of the algorithm, ≈∑_ig will be maximized, but with no explicit control over the complementary probabilities.	O	O	Reply	353
There are two objectives that are optimized over the same variable theta.	O	O	Reply	353
So the question is, are we sure that this procedure will converge?	O	O	Reply	353
What prevents situations where the probabilities will alternate between two values?	O	O	Reply	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For example, with 4 classes, we look at the predicted probabilities of a given sample of class 1:[line_break_token]Suppose after step 1 of Algo 1, the predicted probabilities are:  0.5 0.3 0.1 0.1 [line_break_token]After step 2:  0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3[line_break_token]Then step 1: 0.5 0.3 0.1 0.1[line_break_token]Then step 2: 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3[line_break_token]And so on...

Did the algorithm have trouble converging in any of the experiments?	O	O	Reply	353
[line_break_token][line_break_token](A2) Thanks for the detailed comment.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	353
As the reviewer pointed out, ‚Äúdrives ≈∑_ij to 1/(K ‚àí 1)‚Äù was indeed a typo and should be corrected to ‚Äúdrive ≈∑_ij /(1 ‚àí ≈∑_ig) to 1/(K-1)‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	353
We have modified the manuscript correspondingly.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	353
Indeed, maximizing complement entropy in Eq(2) only drives ‚Äú≈∑_ij /(1 ‚àí ≈∑_ig) to 1/(K-1)‚Äù, and therefore in the example provided above, the predicted probabilities after step 2 can be ‚Äú0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3‚Äù or ‚Äú0.5, (1 - 0.5)/3, (1 - 0.5)/3, (1 - 0.5)/3‚Äù, or other values so long as the incorrect classes (≈∑_ij's) receive similar predicted probabilities.

This paper adds an interesting twist on top of recent unpaired image translation work.	O	O	Review	472
A domain-level translation function is jointly optimized with an instance-level matching objective.	O	O	Review	472
This yields the ability to extract corresponding image pairs out of two unpaired datasets, and also to potentially refine unpaired translation by subsequently training a paired translation function on the discovered matches.	O	O	Review	472
I think this is a promising direction, but the current paper has unconvincing results, and it‚Äôs not clear if the method is really solving an important problem yet.	O	O	Review	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My main criticism is with the experiments and results.	B-Review	B-1	Review	472
The experiments focus almost entirely on the setting where there actually exist exact matches between the two image sets.	I-Review	I-1	Review	472
Even the partial matching experiments in Section 4.1.2 only quantify performance on the images that have exact matches.	I-Review	I-1	Review	472
This is a major limitation since the compelling use cases of the method are in scenarios where we do not have exact matches.	I-Review	I-1	Review	472
It feels rather contrived to focus so much on the datasets with exact matches since, 1) these datasets actually come as paired data and, in actual practice, supervised translation can be run directly, 2) it‚Äôs hard to imagine datasets that have exact but unknown matches (I welcome the authors to put forward some such scenarios), 3) when exact matches exist, simpler methods may be sufficient, such as matching edges.	B-Review	B-2	Review	472
There is no comparison to any such simple baselines.	B-Review	B-3	Review	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I think finding analogies that are not exact matches is much more compelling.	B-Review	B-4	Review	472
Quantifying performance in this case may be hard, and the current paper only offers a few qualitative results.	I-Review	I-4	Review	472
I‚Äôd like to see far more results, and some attempt at a metric.	I-Review	I-4	Review	472
One option would be to run user studies where humans judge the quality of the matches.	I-Review	I-4	Review	472
The results shown in Figure 2 don‚Äôt convince me, not just because they are qualitative and few, but also because I‚Äôm not sure I even agree that the proposed method is producing better results: for example, the DiscoGAN results have some artifacts but capture the texture better in row 3.	I-Review	I-4	Review	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I was also not convinced by the supervised second step in Section 4.3.	B-Review	B-5	Review	472
Given that the first step achieves 97% alignment accuracy, it‚Äôs no surprised that running an off-the-shelf supervised method on top of this will match the performance of running on 100% correct data.	I-Review	I-5	Review	472
In other words, this section does not really add much new information beyond what we could already infer given that the first stage alignment was so successful.	I-Review	I-5	Review	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]What I think would be really interesting is if the method can improve performance on datasets that actually do not have ground truth exact matches.	B-Review	B-4	Review	472
For example, the shoes and handbags dataset or even better, domain adaptation datasets like sim to real.	I-Review	I-4	Review	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I‚Äôd like to see more discussion of why the second stage supervised problem is beneficial.	B-Review	B-5	Review	472
Would it not be sufficient to iterate alpha and T iterations enough times until alpha is one-hot and T is simply training against a supervised objective (Equation 7)?	I-Review	I-5	Review	472

[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper is focused on exact analogy identification.	O	O	Reply	472
A core question in the reviews was the motivation for the scenario of exact matching, and we were challenged by the reviewer to find real world applications for it.	O	O	Reply	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We believe that finding exact matches is an important problem and occurs in multiple real-world problems.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	472
Exact or near-exact matching occurs in: [line_break_token]* 3D point cloud matching.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
[line_break_token]* Matching between different cameras panning the same scene in different trajectories (hard if they are in different modalities such as RGB and IR).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
[line_break_token]* Matching between the audio samples of two speakers uttering the same set of sentences.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
[line_break_token]* Two repeats of the same scripted activity (recipe, physics experiment, theatrical show)[line_break_token]* Two descriptions of the same news event in different styles (at the sentence level or at the story level).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
[line_break_token]* Matching parallel dictionary definitions and visual collections.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
[line_break_token]* Learning to play one racket sport after knowing to play another, building on the existing set of acquired movements and skills.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In all these cases, there are exact or near exact analogies that could play a major rule in forming unsupervised links between the domains.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]We note that on a technical level, most numerical benchmarks in cross domain translation are already built using exact matches, and many of the unsupervised techniques could be already employing this information, even if implicitly.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
We show that our method is more effective at it than other methods.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]On a more theoretical level, cognitive theories of analogy-based reasoning mostly discuss exact analogies from memory (see, e.g., G. Fauconnier, and M. Turner, ‚ÄúThe way we think‚Äù, 2002 ).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
For example, a new situation is dealt with by retrieving and adopting a motor action that was performed before.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
Here, the chances of finding such analogies are high since the source domain is heavily populated due to life experiences.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding experiments.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
We believe that in some cases the requests are conflicting: we cannot provide numerical results in places for which there are no analogies and no metrics for success.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
We provide a large body of experiments for exact matches and show that our method far surpasses everything else.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
We have compared with multiple baselines covering all the reasonable successful approaches for matching between domains.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experiments regarding cases without exact matches are, admittedly, less extensive, added for completeness, and not the focus of this paper.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The reviewer wondered if matching will likely work better with simpler methods.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	472
Our baselines test precisely this possibility and show that the simpler methods do not perform well.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	472
Specifically edge-based matches are well covered by the more general VGG feature baseline (which uses also low level maps - not just fc7).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	472
AN-GAN has easily outperformed this method.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	472
If it is possible to hand-craft a successful method for each task individually, these hand-crafted features are unlikely to generalize as well as the multi-scale VGG features or AN-GAN.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We put further clarification in the paper for the motivation for the second ‚Äúsupervised‚Äù step.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	472
In unsupervised semantic matching, larger neural architecture have been theoretically and practically shown to be less successful (due to overfitting and finding it less easy to recover the correct transformation).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	472
The distribution matching loss function (e.g. CycleGAN) is adversarial and is therefore less stable and might not optimize the quantity we care about (e.g. L1/L2 loss).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	472
Once the datasets are aligned and analogies are identified, however, the cross domain translation becomes a standard supervised deep learning problem where large architectures do well and standard loss functions can be used.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	472
This is the reason for the two steps.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	472
It might be possible to include the increase in architecture into the alpha-iterations but it‚Äôs non-trivial and we didn‚Äôt find it necessary.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	472

The paper presents a method for finding related images (analogies) from different domains based on matching-by-synthesis.	O	O	Review	472
The general idea is interesting and the results show improvements over previous approaches, such as CycleGAN (with different initializations, pre-learned or not).	O	O	Review	472
The algorithm is tested on three datasets.	O	O	Review	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While the approach has some strong positive points, such as good experiments and theoretical insights (the idea to match by synthesis and the proposed loss which is novel, and combines the proposed concepts), the paper lacks clarity and sufficient details.	B-Review	B-1	Review	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Instead of the longer intro and related work discussion, I would prefer to see a Figure with the architecture and more illustrative examples to show that the insights are reflected in the experiments.	I-Review	I-1	Review	472
Also, the matching part, which is discussed at the theoretical level, could be better explained and presented at a more visual level.	I-Review	I-1	Review	472
It is hard to understand sufficiently well what the formalism means without more insight.	I-Review	I-1	Review	472

Summary:[line_break_token]This submission proposes a reinforcement learning framework based on human emotional reaction in the context of autonomous driving.	O	O	Review	472
This relies on defining a reward function as the convex combination of an extrinsic (goal oriented) reward, and an intrinsic reward.	O	O	Review	472
This later reward is learnt from experiments with humans performing the task in a virtual environment, for which emotional response is quantified as blood volume pulse wave (BVP).	O	O	Review	472
The authors show that including this intrinsic reward lead to a better performance of a deep Q networks, with respect to using the extrinsic reward only.	O	O	Review	472
[line_break_token]Evaluation:[line_break_token]Overall the proposed idea is interesting, and the use of human experiments to improve a reinforcement learning algorithm offers interesting perspectives.	O	O	Review	472
The weakness of the paper in my opinion is the statistical analysis of the results, the lack of in depth evaluation of the extrinsic reward prediction and the rather poor baseline comparison.	O	O	Review	472
[line_break_token]Detailed comments:[line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	472
[tab_token]Statistical analysis[line_break_token]The significance of the results should be assessed with statistical methods in the following results:[line_break_token]Section 4.1: Please provide and assessment of the significance of the testing loss of the prediction.	B-Review	B-1	Review	472
For example, one could repetitively shuffle blocks of the target time series and quantify the RMSE obtained by the trained algorithm to build an H0 statistic of random prediction.	I-Review	I-1	Review	472
[line_break_token]Section 4.2: the sentence ‚Äúimproves significantly when lambda is either non-zero or not equal to 1‚Äù does not seem valid to me and such claim should in any case be properly evaluated statistically (including correction for multiple comparison etc‚Ä¶).	I-Review	I-1	Review	472

[tab_token]Time lags in BVP[line_break_token]It would be interesting to know (from the literature) the typical latency of BVP responses to averse stimuli (and possible the latency of the various mechanisms, e.g. brain response, in the chain from stimuli to BVP).	B-Review	B-2	Review	472
Moreover, as latency is likely a critical factor in anticipating danger before it is too late, it would important to know how the prediction accuracy evolves when learning to predict at different time lags forward in time, and how such level of anticipation influence the performance of the Q-network.

[tab_token]Poor baseline comparison[line_break_token]The comparison to reward shaping in section 4.4 is not very convincing.	B-Review	B-3	Review	472
One can imagine that what counts is not the absolute distance to a wall, but the distance to a wall in the driving direction, within a given solid angle.	I-Review	I-3	Review	472
As a consequence, a better heuristic baseline could be used.	I-Review	I-3	Review	472
[line_break_token]Moreover, it is unclear whether the approaches should be compared with the same lambda: the authors need to provide evidence that the statistics (mean and possibly variance) of the chosen heuristic is match to the original intrinsic reward, otherwise it is obvious that the lambda should be adapted.

Starting from the hypothesis that humans have evolved basic autonomic visceral responses that influence decision making in a meaningful way and that these are at work in driving a car, the authors propose to use such signals within the RL framework.	O	O	Review	472
This is accomplished by augmenting the RL reward function with a model learned directly from human nervous system responses.	O	O	Review	472
This leads to a [line_break_token]convex combination of extrinsic rewards and visceral responses, with the goal to maximize extrinsic rewards and minimizing the physiological arousal response.	O	O	Review	472
The authors first show that they can train a CNN to predict systolic peaks from the pulse waveform based on the input images.	O	O	Review	472
The output of this network is then used with parametrically altered weightings in combination with the task related reward to evaluate performance on different driving tasks.	O	O	Review	472
The authors show that for different weightings performance on a number of driving tasks performance as measured by the collected extrinsic rewards is better.	O	O	Review	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, this is an interesting application of RL.	O	O	Review	472
It is OK to be inspired by biology, neuroscience, or psychology, but further reaching claims or interpretations of results in these fields need to be chosen carefully.	O	O	Review	472
The discussion of neuroscience and psychology are only partially convincing, e.g. there is extensive evidence that autonomic responses are highly dependent on cognition and not just decisions dependent on visceral, autonomic responses of the SNS.	B-Review	B-1	Review	472
Currently, the manuscript is rather loosely switching between inspirations, imprecise claims, and metaphorical implementations with relation to neuroscience.	I-Review	I-1	Review	472
The authors are encouraged to relate their work to some of the multi-criteria and structural credit assignment literature in RL, given the convex combination of rewards.	B-Review	B-2	Review	472
 It may also be important to relate this work to imitation learning, given that the physiological measurements certainly also reflects states and actions by the human agents.	I-Review	I-2	Review	472
While one indication for the reasons of higher extrinsic rewards with the augmented system is mentioned by the authors, namely that the autonomic signal is continuous and while the extrinsic rewards are sparse is convincing, it is not at all clear, why the augmented system performs better as shown in figure 5.

 The qualitative examples also shed light on the types of situations in which the system is likely to get a high or low reward.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	472
Having a less sparse reward that helps the vehicle avoid collisions is beneficial.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	472

The method proposes to use physiological signals to improve performance of reinforcement learning algorithms.	O	O	Review	472
By measuring heart pulse amplitude the authors build an intrinsic reward function that is less sparse that the extrinsic one.	O	O	Review	472
It helps to be risk averse and allows getting better performances than the vanilla RL algorithm on a car-driving task.	O	O	Review	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I found the paper well written and the idea is quite nice.	O	O	Review	472
I like the idea that risk aversion is processed as a data-driven problem and not as an optimisation problem or using heuristics.	O	O	Review	472
I think this general idea could be pushed further in other cases (like encourage fun, surprise, happiness etc. ).	O	O	Review	472
[line_break_token][line_break_token]There are some issues with this paper yet.	O	O	Review	472
First, modifying the reward function also modifies the optimal policy.	B-Review	B-1	Review	472
In the specific case of car driving, it may not be bad to modify the policy so that it makes passenger less stressed but in general, it is not good.	I-Review	I-1	Review	472
This is why most of works based on intrinsic motivation also schedule the lambda parameter to decrease with time.	I-Review	I-1	Review	472
This is not something explored in this paper.	I-Review	I-1	Review	472
Also, this work is well suited to the car-driving scenario because stress is closely related to risk and accident.	B-Review	B-2	Review	472
But it may not work with other applications.	I-Review	I-2	Review	472
I would thus suggest that the title of the paper reflects the specific case of risk aversion.	I-Review	I-2	Review	472

[line_break_token][Summary][line_break_token]This paper studies the relationship between gradient clipping in stochastic gradient descent and robustness to label noise.	O	O	Review	10101
Theoretical results show that gradient clipping in general is not robust to symmetric label noise.	O	O	Review	10101
The paper then proposes a variant of gradient clipping (cl-clipping) that induces label noise robustness.	O	O	Review	10101
Experiments support these claims on synthetic datasets and typical classification benchmarks.	O	O	Review	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Decision][line_break_token]The first contribution, that gradient clipping does not induce robustness to label noise, is an important negative result given the prominence of gradient clipping and datasets with noisy labels.	O	O	Review	10101
The second contribution, cl-clipping, amounts to minimizing a non-convex loss with saturating regions but, as far as I know, these properties are necessary for robustness to label noise.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10101
Theoretical results are limited to SGD with mini-batch size 1 but the insights carry over to larger mini-batches in the experiments.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10101
Overall, I recommend acceptance.	O	O	Review	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Comments][line_break_token]The parameter tau controls robustness, and a higher noise level requires a higher tau.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10101
There is little discussion on how this parameter is chosen in the experiments.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10101
On the synthetic dataset, the Huberized loss uses tau=1 and the partially Huberized loss uses tau=2.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10101
How are these values chosen?	I-Review	I-1	Review	10101
Did the authors observe a U-shaped curve when sweeping over tau?	I-Review	I-1	Review	10101
On the real-world datasets, tau is fixed for each method across different noise levels.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10101
Does this mean that a single value of tau worked best regardless of the noise level, or was it tuned for a particular noise level?	I-Review	I-1	Review	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Proposition 4 shows that symmetric noise breaks down the clipping method in Eq (7) which can be seen as a special case of gradient clipping.	B-Review	B-2	Review	10101
I might be missing something here, but it is not obvious to me that, when the norm of x is constant across the samples, Eq (7) is equal to gradient clipping.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10101

This is a tuning parameter that can be set by the user, similar to the q parameter from generalised cross-entropy, or noise estimates in loss-correction techniques.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101

We did not tune œÑ for each noise rate, since this value of œÑ worked well for lower noise rates as well.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
Of course, there is no conceptual issue with tuning œÑ for each value of œ±, although there is a slight computational cost.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For the range of œÑ, we found that values of œÑ = { 2, 10 } ‚Äî which correspond to clipping at probability values less than 0.5 and 0.1 respectively ‚Äî generally gave good performance for the datasets considered.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
In general, one can certainly expand this range, again with a slight computational cost.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We indeed observe a U-shaped curve in general.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
Note also that as œÑ gets closer to 1, we essentially reduce to the original loss (e.g., log-loss).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
As œÑ gets larger, we essentially reduce to the linear loss.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
As shown in Table 2, intermediate values of œÑ yield better performance than either extreme under label noise.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
We have made a comment on this following the discussion of how œÑ is chosen.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Proposition 4 indeed concerns loss-based gradient clipping, i.e., Equation 7.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	10101
Per the discussion following Lemma 1, this is not exactly the same as gradient clipping in general.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10101
However, note that for linear models, the term ‚àámŒ∏(x, y) = ||x||2, so if this is constant then Equations 6 and 7 will coincide.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10101
We have added some clarifying text after Equation 7	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10101

Summary:[line_break_token][line_break_token]Gradient clipping has been studied as an optimization technique and also as a tool for privacy preserving, but in this paper, it studies the robustness properties of gradient clipping.	O	O	Review	10101
 More specifically, the main question of the paper is: Can gradient clipping mitigate label noise?	O	O	Review	10101
 The paper reveals that the answer is no, but further proposes a simple variant of gradient clipping is robust and has nice property of classification calibration.	O	O	Review	10101
 Experiments show that the proposed variant works under label noise.	O	O	Review	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Strength of the paper:[line_break_token][line_break_token]The motivation and goal of the paper is stated in the title and is very clear, making it easier to follow the story of the paper.	O	O	Review	10101
 There are sufficient background on the loss functions and gradient clipping in the beginning that helps guide the reader.	O	O	Review	10101
 The proposed method is robust to label noise and has theoretical guarantees.	O	O	Review	10101
 The relationship between similar work is summarized.	O	O	Review	10101
 Experiments have both synthetic and benchmark datasets to demonstrate the behavior of the proposed method.	O	O	Review	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Weakness of the paper:[line_break_token][line_break_token]Currently, the experiments only include methods studied in the paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10101

This paper studied a fundamental problem in robust machine learning, that is, can gradient clipping mitigate label noise?	O	O	Review	10101
The paper is well written, clearly motivated, highly novel and significant not only in a theoretical sense but also in a practical sense.	O	O	Review	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As argued in the abstract, gradient clipping is a widely-used technique which is generally motivated from the OPTIMIZATION point of view.	O	O	Review	10101
In this paper, the authors proposed an entirely new motivation of gradient clipping from the ROBUSTNESS point of view, since intuitively it should be able to mitigate label noise.	O	O	Review	10101
Surprisingly, the authors proved that for some simple binary classification with label noise, standard gradient clipping does not provide robustness; on the other hand, a simple variant of gradient clipping is robust, and is equivalent to suitably modifying the underlying loss function.	O	O	Review	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The major contributions were well summarized in the bottom of page 1, the related work was discussed in sec 4.3, and the caveats of this new methodology were also given in sec 4.4.	O	O	Review	10101
Note that the proposed composite loss-based gradient clipping is applicable even on top of existing noise-robust losses, for example, the generalized cross-entropy loss, and this serves as a convincing demonstration of the great significance of the paper.	O	O	Review	10101
Actually, the paper is full of insights, and I really enjoyed reviewing it.	O	O	Review	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I have a few questions on Tables 1 and 2.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10101
Table 1 said the standard gradient clipping is not robust according to Proposition 4.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10101
However, Proposition 4 is for the loss-based gradient clipping in (7) rather than the standard gradient clipping in (6).	I-Review	I-1	Review	10101
Perhaps I have missed something, but why the non-robustness of (7) can imply the non-robustness of (6)?	I-Review	I-1	Review	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In Table 2, Linear loss on MNIST, the test accuracy was 9.6 when rho=0.6.	B-Review	B-2	Review	10101
Is this a typo?	I-Review	I-2	Review	10101
The accuracy was still 78.8 when rho=0.4.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10101
Moreover, the authors explained why the theoretically grounded linear loss performed so badly, that is, the optimization was so difficult.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10101
How about CE+clipping loss on CIFAR-100?	I-Review	I-2	Review	10101
The standard gradient clipping was also harmful here, even when there was no label noise at all.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10101
Was this due to bad optimization or robustness (or both)?	I-Review	I-2	Review	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Since distributionally robust supervised learning is a future direction to go, I think the authors may be interested in a thought-provoking paper:[line_break_token]W. Hu, G. Niu, I. Sato, and M. Sugiyama.	B-Review	B-3	Review	10101

Following the comments to AnonReviewer3, the two are related for linear models when the norms of the inputs are constant; see the discussion following Equation 7.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The results of linear loss on MNIST under high noise are not a typo ‚Äî we observed that the linear loss can sometimes be unstable under high noise levels.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
In particular, the training can completely collapse.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
We hypothesise that one might be able to cope with this by adjusting learning rate schedule, for example, but in the interest of consistency we use the same architecture and settings regardless of noise level.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10101
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding the performance of CE + clipping on CIFAR-100, our intuition is the following: per Lemma 1, clipping is similar to linearising the base loss beyond a certain point. (	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	10101
It is not exactly so owing to the gradient of the margin.)	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10101
Now, we observed that the linear loss does not perform well on CIFAR-100.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10101
One possible explanation for this is given in Sec 4.3, i.e., the gradients with respect to the probability estimates do not contain information about sample importances.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10101
We thus believe this poor performance translates to clipping with low enough thresholds.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10101

GACA is easy to implement and is a generalization of various credit assignment methods(MAPO MML, EML, RAML, and REINFORCE), we want to emphasize that GACA is general and can be further improved by combining it with techniques in other methods to further boost performance, such as meta-learning proposed in MeRL.

Whether the solution is mutual information or not seems not helpful for getting better credit assignment.	I-Review	I-6	Review	627

The 2 tricks used here for estimating the gradient of f-divergence with respect to \pi_\theta, i.e., modified MAPO estimator in Prop.	O	O	Review	627

[line_break_token]However, motivation is not clear enough.	B-Review	B-4	Review	627
First, why using two replay buffers "leads to a better approximation"?	I-Review	I-4	Review	627
Any theory/intuition or experiment to support this claim?	I-Review	I-4	Review	627
Second, why using inverse tail probability "achieve a trade-off between exploration and exploitation".	B-Review	B-5	Review	627
It seems not obvious to see that.	I-Review	I-5	Review	627
And also, explain why using this trick makes "\pi_\theta adaptively coverage and approximate prior distribution \bar{\pi}".	I-Review	I-5	Review	627
[line_break_token][line_break_token]6.	B-Review	B-2	Review	627
The claim that GACA recovers all the mentioned methods as special cases are questionable.	B-Review	B-3	Review	627
For example, as in E.1, "by simply choosing \rho_f as constant 1", comparing Eq. (	I-Review	I-3	Review	627
12) with the gradient of REINFORCE, there is a difference that REINFORCE has a reward term, but GACA does not have.	I-Review	I-3	Review	627
Then why GACA reduces to REINFORCE?	I-Review	I-3	Review	627
Also in E.5, the RAML objective seems wrong.	I-Review	I-3	Review	627
There is no reward term here.	I-Review	I-3	Review	627
Please check them.	I-Review	I-3	Review	627
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, the proposed GACA method achieves promising results in program synthesis tasks.	O	O	Review	627
However, there are many concerns with respect to motivation and techniques that should be resolved.	O	O	Review	627

I keep my rating since some of my concerns are still not resolved.	O	O	Review	627
In particular, "Eq. (	B-Review	B-7	Review	627
8) is the optimal solution of KL Eq. (	I-Review	I-7	Review	627
7).	I-Review	I-7	Review	627
Is it also the optimal solution of f-divergence used in the algorithm?"	I-Review	I-7	Review	627
Eq. (	B-Review	B-2	Review	627
8) looks not the same as the paragraph above Lemma 2 "\bar{\pi} = \pi_\theta" to me.	B-Review	B-7	Review	627
If Eq. (	I-Review	I-7	Review	627
8) is not the optimal solution of Eq. (	I-Review	I-7	Review	627
11), the update in Alg.	I-Review	I-7	Review	627
1 is somewhat problematic and other better choices exist.	I-Review	I-7	Review	627

Summary:[line_break_token]This work proposed an off-policy framework for policy gradient approach called[line_break_token]guided adaptive credit assignment (GACA) in a simplified setting of goal-oriented[line_break_token]entropy regularized RL.	O	O	Review	627
[line_break_token]GACA optimizes the policy via fitting a learnable prior distribution that using[line_break_token]both high reward trajectory and zero reward trajectory to improve the sample efficiency.	O	O	Review	627
 [line_break_token]The experiments on sparse reward tasks such as WikiTableQuestions and WikiSQL[line_break_token]demonstrate the effectiveness of the GACA, comparing with a set of advanced baselines.	O	O	Review	627
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Detailed comments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]Off-policy learning:[line_break_token]The Environment dynamic is not considered.	O	O	Review	627
The trajectory[line_break_token]reward is determined by the initial state, goal, and the sequence of actions taken thereafter.	O	O	Review	627
The off-policy learning can be applied since the distribution of[line_break_token]initial state, and goal is not affected by the policy.	O	O	Review	627
This reduces to a[line_break_token]weighted maximum likelihood problem.	O	O	Review	627
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Resolving the sparse reward issue:[line_break_token]In sparse reward tasks, many of trajectories have zero rewards, in order to utilize[line_break_token]the zero reward trajectory (since in the weighted problem those samples have no[line_break_token]contribution to the gradient).	O	O	Review	627
This work proposed to store the trajectories[line_break_token]into two replay buffers and samples from both of them separately.	B-Review	B-8	Review	627
[line_break_token]Intuitively, it is not clear to me why minimizing mutual information between z and[line_break_token]reward would help the learning.	I-Review	I-8	Review	627
I am suspecting the reason is that mutual information brings non-zero gradient for zero reward trajectories (given zero-reward trajectories indeed helps the learning).	I-Review	I-8	Review	627
[line_break_token]The authors also claimed that KL divergence performs worse than f-divergence due to the mode seeking issue.	B-Review	B-1	Review	627
Do the experiments in GACA w/o AG support this claim?	I-Review	I-1	Review	627

> - A brief summary of the paper's contributions, in the context of prior work.	O	O	Review	76
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The way we represent data -- the features we use -- has proven essential to a wide variety of tasks in machine learning.	O	O	Review	76
Often, the trivial features we naturally get from the data perform poorly.	O	O	Review	76
One approach is to hand-engineer features, having humans carefully construct features based on their understanding of the data and the task.	O	O	Review	76
Another approach, taken in deep learning, is to learn features as part of the optimization process of a multi-layer model.	O	O	Review	76
This paper proposes an alternative approach in which 'super-features' are generated by an iterative exploration process.	O	O	Review	76
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As the reviewer understands it, this iterative process begins with random sigmoidial features.	O	O	Review	76
Features are evaluated on several subsets of the dataset and good features are selected.	O	O	Review	76
Principal component analysis is performed on the parameters of the good features in order to define a lower-dimensional space of good features.	O	O	Review	76
The next iteration proceeds on products of the principal components discovered in the previous step.	O	O	Review	76
In the limit, the discovered features form a space with nice algebraic properties.	O	O	Review	76
[line_break_token][line_break_token]> - An assessment of novelty and quality.	O	O	Review	76
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The reviewer is not an expert but to the best of their knowledge this approach is novel.	O	O	Review	76
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The reviewer is concerned that this paper may be a bit rushed: it suffers from many grammatical errors, and some parts of the paper are hard to follow.	O	O	Review	76
The reviewer thinks that a bit of further revision would greatly benefit this paper.	O	O	Review	76
[line_break_token][line_break_token]> - A list of pros and cons (reasons to accept/reject)[line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros:[line_break_token]* The paper introduces some interesting, novel ideas.	O	O	Review	76
In particular, attempting to do dimensionality reduction in parameter space seems like a really interesting strategy. (	O	O	Review	76
I'm concerned that PCA may not be a very good way to do this, but the idea is very interesting.)	B-Review	B-3	Review	76
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons:[line_break_token]* The paper does not do any experiments to test the efficacy of the proposed approach.	B-Review	B-1	Review	76
Given how radically different the proposed approach is from things that have been previously tried, it seems really difficult to have any significant confidence in it without experimental results. (	I-Review	I-1	Review	76
Not having experimental results for this would seem more appropriate if this were a workshop track submission.)	I-Review	I-1	Review	76
[line_break_token]* The paper suffers from many grammatical issues.	B-Review	B-2	Review	76
These really need to be fixed in a final version of this paper.	I-Review	I-2	Review	76
[line_break_token]* The paper is quite hard to follow at some points.	B-Review	B-3	Review	76
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Testing this approach on a standard dataset would also provide an opportunity for the author to walk the reader through a concrete application of this approach, in addition to providing experimental validation of it.	O	O	Review	76

This paper proposes an initialization scheme for the recently introduced linear memory network (LMN) (Bacciu et al 2019) and the authors claim that this initialization scheme can help improving the model performance of long-term sequential learning problems.	O	O	Review	20276
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My concerns lie with the novelty of the proposed model and the insufficiency of the experiments.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20276
First, the LMN seems to be a simpler version of LSTM and it has no significant advantages compared with other recurrent structures introduced in the past several years.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20276
[line_break_token]Second, the autoencoder-based init scheme (Pasa&amp;Sperduti, 2014) is not new while the only technical contribution of this paper is a minor change of this scheme so that it works for the LMN.	O	O	Review	20276
In my opinion, combining these two (LMN and init scheme) can hardly be considered as a solid novelty contribution.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20276
[line_break_token]For the experiment part, the first two tasks are a bit toyish in 2019 and I have not seen any significant improvement gained from the proposed model.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20276
Even for the TIMIT dataset, the results are a bit far from state-of-the-art which makes the paper's claim less convincing.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20276
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall I think the novelty contribution is marginal and I suggest the authors to test their models on larger-scale real problems.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20276
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The writing is clear and easy to follow.	O	O	Review	20276
ou can, of course, obtain the LMN from the LSTM equations by eliminating all the gates and making the CEC update through a generic linear function (in place of the sum).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20276
But these are not minor changes and radically change the inductive bias of the models.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20276
 The LSTM uses the forget gate to reset the cell state activations, while the LMN uses a more efficient encoding and does not forget past activations.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20276
The result of this choice is that the LMN is better on tasks that require the memorization of long sequences (e.g. copy task, MNIST).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20276
On different tasks, like language modeling, other architectures (like the LSTM) are probably a better choice since the problem does not require explicit memorization.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20276
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]You are correct that the initialization scheme come from a previous contribution.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20276
 However, what we show here is that such initialization is more coherent with the assumption and nature of the LMN, rather than for a RNN with non-linear memory.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20276
We also show how that the autoencoder initialization can help in some tasks (improving both the results of orthogonal and gated models) and hinder the performance in others.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20276
These results show that the proposed approach is complementary to LSTMs and other gated architectures, and that the two approaches can be used to solve different tasks of different nature (in terms of long and short-term memorization abilities).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20276
We are not aware of other researches investigating the differences between encoding/orthogonal-based approaches and gated models and the capabilities of the different memorization schemes (which, to the extent of our understanding, appears a relevant topic for ICLR).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20276

Summary:[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper proposes an autoencoder-based initialization for RNNs with linear memory.	O	O	Review	20276
The proposed initialization is aimed at helping to maintain longer-term memory and instability during training such as  exploding gradients (due to linearity).	O	O	Review	20276

The experiments on the copy task only showed results for length upto 500, which almost all baseline models are able to solve.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20276

TIMNIT is a relatively small speech recognition dataset.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20276

[line_break_token][line_break_token]4.	O	O	Review	20276
In general, it seems that the experiments could be more carefully designed to reflect the contributions of the proposed method.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20276
Some suggestions for future edits are, more analysis on gradients, maybe more experiments on the stability of training such as gradients could help.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20276

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The technique bears some resemblance to Wasserstein Discriminant[line_break_token]Analysis.[1]  That paper seeks a projection that maximizes the ratio of [line_break_token]Wasserstein distance between classes vs. within classes.	B-Review	B-5	Review	272
 Here, [line_break_token]although the common representation is a nonlinear mapping [line_break_token]analogous to a projection, we merely try to estimate all the[line_break_token]Wasserstein distances rather than maximize them, so it is not trained[line_break_token]to be discriminative per se.	I-Review	I-5	Review	272
  That is ok since the representation is[line_break_token]designed to be used for a variety of tasks (modulo section 4.2), but it [line_break_token]does leave open the question "what if the matrix of estimated [line_break_token]Wasserstein distances isn't informative, e.g., due to poor choice of [line_break_token]environments?"

 However clearly if[line_break_token]the capacity of this layer is too small, then all estimated WDs will[line_break_token]be close to zero.	I-Review	I-6	Review	272
 If we posit a low Bayes error classifier for the[line_break_token]multi-class problem associated with the dataset, that might imply there[line_break_token]is some conditioning of the input under which the matrix of (actual) WDs[line_break_token]has rank equal to the number of classes, which would in turn provide a[line_break_token]useful diagnostic to guard against an insufficiently discriminative choice[line_break_token]of environments or insufficient capacity in the common representation.

If[line_break_token]the matrix is full rank with a flat spectrum, however, that might indicate[line_break_token]the choice of environments is too granular and overfitting has occurred,[line_break_token]it's not immediately obvious to me how to guard against this.	I-Review	I-6	Review	272

The paper proposes to use a multi-step prediction model in model-based RL.	O	O	Review	656
The proposed model maps from current state and a sequence of actions to the state after taking those actions.	O	O	Review	656
The paper demonstrates on 2 tasks that in a model-predictive control loop combined with planning by cross-entropy method, this can yield better asymptotic performance than using single-step models.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The insight of using multi-step prediction models is certainly appealing and makes a lot of sense in deterministic tasks.	O	O	Review	656
A systematic empirical comparison of multi-step deep models in RL is of interest, which this paper does provide to some extent.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]An obvious limitation of the proposed deterministic multi-step forward model is the restriction to deterministic systems.	B-Review	B-1	Review	656
One would expect that the performance deteriorates quickly as the system becomes more stochastic.	I-Review	I-1	Review	656
An extension to the stochastic case along the lines of Chua et al, 2018 is non-trivial as capturing the stochasticity is typically more challenging in long-term predictions.	I-Review	I-1	Review	656
Yet, the paper makes an additional assumption that is less clearly communicated: To be able to plan with a R-step model, one needs to be able to evaluate or approximate the sum of R rewards just from the first and last state in that R-long sequence.	B-Review	B-2	Review	656
This work uses simply the reward at the end r(s_{t+R}) as a proxy which works well in these MuJoCo tasks but can fail horribly in others.	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
One can imagine that a model not only outputs s_{t+R} but also the sum of R rewards given s_t and a_{t:t+R} which could work in more general settings but this is not explored in this paper.	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
The contribution in this paper limited as the proposed approach as well as the experimental comparison is restricted to a relatively specific class of problems and no attempts to generalize are made.	B-Review	B-3	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experiments nicely compare against using single-step dynamics models and the results show that using the multi-step models for MPC performs better in the two considered tasks.	O	O	Review	656
However, as fas as I understand both the ACP and Chua et al baseline using the single-step prediction accuracy to train their models.	B-Review	B-4	Review	656
The paper is missing a comparison to single-step models that are trained using multi-step prediction losses ("backprop through time" as in Learning Nonlinear Dynamic Models by Langford et al 2009).	I-Review	I-4	Review	656
These models should be much more robust to error blow-up for multi-step prediction and do not require the specific reward structure assumed in this paper.	I-Review	I-4	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The proposed R-step model-based RL approach could be connected to the use of options (the planner and model operate on R-step options, but the MPC does update the policy after every time step).	O	O	Review	656
It would be interesting to discuss this potential connection in the paper.	O	O	Review	656
The paper does a good job of discussing existing recent work in the deep RL literature but it would also be good to also discuss earlier work on multi-step prediction (e.g. in time-series modeling).	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]All in all, I think the paper makes a small contribution demonstrating that multi-step models are useful for model-based RL in specific domains -- which is interesting but certainly not surprising.	O	O	Review	656
Unfortunately the paper stops somewhat early by not comparing to relevant baselines (single-step models trained with multi-step losses) and by not considering tasks where the benefit of multi-step planning would be less clear.	O	O	Review	656
We thank the reviewer for a very detailed review.	O	O	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]"capturing the stochasticity is typically more challenging in long-term predictions": Yes, this is an interesting direction.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	656
Such a model would need the ability to produce complex multimodal distributions of outcomes.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
As our goal in this work was to understand why existing methods failed even on deterministic tasks, we leave it to future work to propose classes of multi-step models appropriate for stochastic environments.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]"This work uses simply the reward at the end": In fact, our model is able to use reward at intermediate time steps.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	656
To do this, we can use the variable-action-length version of our model, as used for visualization (mentioned in Section 2.2 paragraph 2 of the original version).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
We also use this version in Fig 5.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
to evaluate prediction error as a function of timesteps in the future.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
We have added Section 2.2.1 to clarify this.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In our main experiments we use a transformed version of the reward function to select trajectories which have an outcome with the greatest x-axis position.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
This is approximately equal to the sum of the rewards obtained along the trajectory under the original reward function, which provides a reward at each timestep proportional to the forward progress at that timestep.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
We have updated Section 2.3.1 to better reflect this.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We apologize for not making these points more clear in the paper.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]"single-step models that are trained using multi-step prediction losses": Yes, we agree that other models which directly minimize long-term prediction error will also produce better predictions that single-step models.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	656
However, the main goal of this work is to point out the deficiencies of the single-step class of models typically used in the field.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656
As such, we simply chose one simple member of the class of multistep models to illustrate our point.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We have since run experiments to evaluate the potential of recurrent training of single-step models with multi-step loss functions.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656
While using a multi-step loss provides significant improvement over a single-step loss, the PCP remains somewhat more accurate.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656
We have updated Figure 5 and the related text with this result.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We furthermore have run these RNN models on the full bootstrapped planning task.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656
Planning with these models is hugely slower than with the PCP, as for each prediction of length H the RNN must be run forward H times, whereas the PCP need only be run H/R times; that is, the RNNs take 50 times as long on Swimmer.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656
We have included preliminary results with RNNs in Figure 7 and will update the paper with the completed experiments before camera ready.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656
We do not believe these results alter the message of the paper.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The Langford et al reference is very helpful and we will add a discussion of this paper to our related work.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656

The authors learn a model that predicts the state R steps in the future, given the current state and intervening actions, instead of the predicting the next time step state.	O	O	Review	656
The model is then used for standard model predictive control.	O	O	Review	656
The authors find numerically that their method, termed Plan-Conditional Predictor (PCP), performs better over long horizon times (~100 time steps), than other recent model-based and model-free algorithms.	O	O	Review	656
This because for long horizon time scales, the model predicting the state for the next time step accumulates error when used recursively.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The key idea is to use a model that directly predicts multiple time steps into the future.	O	O	Review	656
While seemingly an obvious extension, it does not appear to have been used in current algorithms.	O	O	Review	656
A main issue that I find with this approach is: since only the state after R steps is predicted, reward r(s_t,a_t) can only be used every R steps, not at every step.	B-Review	B-1	Review	656
The authors gloss over this issue because for both MuJoCo environments that they tested, they only need to consider reward at the end of the planning horizon.	I-Review	I-1	Review	656
Thus to make their algorithm generally applicable, the authors also need to show how or whether their method can deal with rewards that may appear at any time step.	I-Review	I-1	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Further, rather than speculate on the cause of the difference between their PCP and PETS (Chua et al 2018) on half-cheetah to be their different settings for CEM optimization (Fig 7b), the authors should just use the same settings to compare.	B-Review	B-2	Review	656
Possibly the authors ran out of time to do this for the current submission, but should certainly do it for the final version.	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While the authors have already compared to other algorithms with similar aims, eg Chua et al 2018, they may also wish to compare to a recent preprint Clavera et al Sep 2018, which also aims to combine the sample efficiency of model-based methods while achieving the performance of model-free ones, by using an ensemble of models, over a 200 time step horizon.	B-Review	B-3	Review	656
However, given the recency of this algorithm, I don't consider this essential.	I-Review	I-3	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, I feel that the authors idea of an R-step model is worth spreading in the community, if the above two main points are addressed.	O	O	Review	656
At the same time, I can only rate it at the border of the cutoff mark.	O	O	Review	656

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Comparison btw.	O	O	Reply	656
PCP & PETS: We directly compared PCP and PETS using the same CEM settings and found the PETS performance to be poor (1350 reward instead of 4600).	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	656
This is because our CEM implementations differ in details; most significantly, we warm start our planner with the plans from the previous timestep, similar to [1]. This means our CEM yields significantly better results with a smaller number of planning trajectories.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
Given this difference in methods we feel the most fair comparison is to evaluate their method with the hyperparameters from their paper.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The Clavera et al paper was released less than 2 weeks before the ICLR deadline.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	656

###  Summary [line_break_token]- The paper tries to understand what learning principles can lead to representations that allow zero-shot learning/generalization.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token]- It explores the impact of two properties -- locality and compositionality -- on ZSL performance.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token]- To encourage locality (and also compositionality since they can overlap), the paper uses an auxiliary loss at an earlier layer (when the receptive field of features is small) to predict local attributes.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token]- For interpreting local features, the paper computes MI between the global feature map of one image and local features from a different image of the same class and visualizes it using a heatmap.	O	O	Review	656
 [line_break_token]- It uses normalized TRE to measure compositionality (Normalized to take into account that some methods are biased towards learning more compositional representations.)	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token]- It compares supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised representation learning methods and studies the impact of locality and compositionality on ZSL performance for these methods.	O	O	Review	656

[line_break_token][line_break_token]### Supporting arguments for the reasons for the decision.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Positives: [line_break_token][line_break_token]1- I agree with the paper that ZSL setting is more about uncovering learning principles and less about constructing practical systems that can do well in zero-shot settings.	O	O	Review	656
In a practical setting, it doesn't make much sense to zero-shot learning anyway.	O	O	Review	656
I also agree that current ZSL work is focusing too much on pushing the state-of-the-art using pre-trained imagenet features and missing the actual goal of the problem setting (I wouldn't say we shouldn't do that at all, however.	O	O	Review	656
Some learning principles may require a significant amount of data to learn good representations for zero-shot learning, and imagenet pretraining is a good proxy for that).	O	O	Review	656
This paper acts as a good reminder that ZSL research should be done keeping in mind the goal of ZSL.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2- The paper first defines locality and compositionality.	O	O	Review	656
It then uses interesting and meaningful metrics for empirically testing if these properties correlate with zero-shot performance.	O	O	Review	656
I found the experiment designs to be clever (such as computing parts F-1 score using boolean maps, visualizing MI between local and global features of images from the same class, etc).	O	O	Review	656
 I think this paper will act as an important reference for motivating future work on learning more modular representations.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Negatives: [line_break_token][line_break_token]1- The paper doesn't try to explain the possible reasons behind some observations.	B-Review	B-1	Review	656
For example, why does locality not correlate with ZSL performance of generative models?	I-Review	I-1	Review	656
Why does LC loss hurt performance for CMDIM?	B-Review	B-2	Review	656
[line_break_token]2- CMDIM draws positive samples from other images of the same class.	B-Review	B-3	Review	656
As a result, it's not a truly unsupervised learning method.	I-Review	I-3	Review	656
The direct comparison of CMDIM to DIM seems unfair.	I-Review	I-3	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]### Questions[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q1-  Computation of the local classification and attribute auxiliary loss is a bit unclear.	B-Review	B-4	Review	656
How is it assured that a certain attribute is present in the local feature when computing the auxiliary attribute-loss?	I-Review	I-4	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q2- Did the authors try a baseline in which AC is also trained on the global representation in the context of Figure 2?	B-Review	B-5	Review	656
The extra information about the parts may be the reason behind better ZSL performance, and a global AC could improve ZSL performance without improving Parts F1 score (Although a more likely outcome is that a global AC would increase both the parts F1 score and the ZSL accuracy.)	I-Review	I-5	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q3- For VAEs, the local F-1 score does not correlate with ZSL performance.	B-Review	B-6	Review	656
This seems to contradict the idea locality leads to better ZSL performance.	I-Review	I-6	Review	656
Is there an explanation for this?	I-Review	I-6	Review	656
The paper just glances over this by calling this 'interesting.'	I-Review	I-6	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q4- Can CMDIM be considered a self-supervised algorithm?	B-Review	B-7	Review	656
Doesn't it need class labels to draw positive samples from the same class?	I-Review	I-7	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]### Other minor remarks [line_break_token][line_break_token]- "Formally, f(x) \elem R is compositional if it can be expressed as a combination of the elements of ..."[line_break_token][line_break_token]The definition would be more clear if the authors could mention some reasonable combination operators here (such as weighted average etc).	B-Review	B-8	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- "However, this choice in architecture does not guarantee locality, as CNN representations could only contain ‚Äúglobal‚Äù information, such as the class or color of the object, despite having a limited receptive field. "	B-Review	B-9	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I'm not sure what this means.	I-Review	I-9	Review	656
Why are CNN representations restricted to 'only' global information?	I-Review	I-9	Review	656

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Why does LC loss hurt CMDIM performance?	O	O	Reply	656
[line_break_token][tab_token]We hypothesize this is due to the fact that both CMDIM and the LC loss focus on discriminating classes at the local level, and that the LC objective is inherently less effective than the CMDIM formulation for this task (in terms of downstream ZSL performance).	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	656
As a result, forcing the model to account for both terms lowers downstream performance.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
A more detailed explanation has been added to 5.1.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Questions.	O	O	Reply	656
[line_break_token]Q1.	O	O	Reply	656
We do not have ground truth values for the local presence or absence of an attribute (this might be feasible on CUB by combining part information with attributes which sometimes map to specific parts such as tail color, but impossible on SUN and AWA2 by construction).	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	656
As a result, we consider the ground-truth value for each local feature (attribute or class) to be that of its class.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656
This means that some uninformative features are counted in the loss term (e.g. a local feature corresponding to pure background will not be able to predict the class or the attributes) but on average, the loss term encourages local features to capture class/attribute information when possible.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656
More complex setups in the field of attribute detection tend to use attention mechanisms to mitigate the effect of taking into account uninformative local features (such as a feature mapping to the background of the image) [1] but are outside the scope of this work.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q2.	O	O	Reply	656
[line_break_token]We initially ran experiments where we considered versions of AC and LC on the global representation.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	656
For AC this is equivalent to multi-task learning combining the model and a ProtoNet.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	656
For LC the same applies for a supervised classifier.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	656
[line_break_token]The addition of the global loss changed learning dynamics (e.g. VAEs tended to ignore the reconstruction term) and overall hyperparameter selection resulted in either:[line_break_token]Weaker (in terms of ZSL accuracy) models focusing on the AC and LC at the expense of their own loss term[line_break_token]Stronger models mainly ignoring AC and LC.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	656
[line_break_token]The part accuracy overall changed in a similar fashion: either staying close to the original model (ignoring AC/LC) or converging towards that of FC/PN.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	656
As this did not provide useful insights into the original model, we dropped this line of investigation.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	656
We believe local AC/LC behave differently as local versions of PN and FC do not dominate the performance of other models.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Q3.	O	O	Reply	656
[line_break_token]This observation is actually more generally true for all models that include a reconstruction objective, such as VAEs but also AAEs, as outlined in figure 2.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	656
We hypothesize that this is due to the fact that such models already have a good understanding of local information (essential for reconstructing) which is not really improved by the local objectives.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
The main issue with those models is that they might be ‚Äútoo local‚Äù: focusing on capturing non-essential (from a class-discriminative point of view) local information, such as an image background, at the expense of more important aspects of an image.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
[line_break_token]In addition to this, these models score poorly in terms of the measures of compositionality we have introduced.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
While we have considered locality and compositionality separately, they interact, and a model that is aware of local parts, but unable to combine them effectively will be weaker at ZSL.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q4.	O	O	Reply	656
CMDIM is indeed a (weakly) supervised learning algorithm and does draw positive samples from the same class.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	656
Overall the goal of introducing this model is to show the improvement one can achieve by changing the nature of positive/negative samples in DIM to learn class-discriminative rather than instance-discriminative features.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	656
We have clarified the category name in 4.1 to highlight this (we put it in the same category as DIM/AMDIM due to conceptual similarities).	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	656

UPDATE: My recommendation has been borderline because the discussion of the paper about the nature of locality and compositionality seems to be less in-depth than I would have expected, but if the authors will revise the submission to shift the focus of the paper to more focused on analysis and evaluation and weaken the claims that their model exhibits locality and compositionality, I would lean towards an accept as the empirical evaluation is extensive.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]----[line_break_token]Summary: This paper aims to investigate the role of locality and compositionality in zero-shot learning.	O	O	Review	656
The authors propose a novel evaluation setup that differs from the original zero-shot learning framework in that the model is not allowed to be pretrained on another dataset.	O	O	Review	656
The authors propose several methods for learning and visualizing local representations.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The overall problem the paper tackles is quite ambitious which involve many parts: defining locality and compositionality, defining constraints for enforcing locality and compositionality, evaluating the existence of locality and compositionality, and evaluating model performance.	B-Review	B-3	Review	656
Because of the extensive nature of the research problem, the coverage of each piece of this research problem in this paper could have been more thorough: for example, I would be really excited for a more in-depth analysis on methods for enforcing locality, but the authors consider only one method, which is the auxiliary loss, and this method does not seem to be applicable for datasets that do not have attribute labels.	I-Review	I-3	Review	656
Given the formalism in section 2.1, I would furthermore be excited about a more in-depth analysis on methods for enforcing compositionality, but the authors only investigate compositionality from the perspective of a weighted average.	I-Review	I-3	Review	656
As a result, the claims about whether enforcing locality and compositionality helps with generalization seem weak, as the authors only do not seem to consider different ways of achieving locality and compositionality -- it is not clear whether their method for enforcing locality (with auxiliary losses) or compositionality (by explicitly performing a weighted average) is representative of enforcing locality and compositionality in general.	I-Review	I-3	Review	656
Furthermore, locality seems to be more of a statement about *ignoring* information (discussed below), which the authors do not explore.	I-Review	I-3	Review	656
As a result, my recommendation is borderline.	I-Review	I-3	Review	656
Perhaps the paper could benefit by reframing it with a more specific focus, with more emphasis on the evaluation, which the paper seems to do well.	I-Review	I-3	Review	656
I would recommend that the authors either (1) perform a more extensive analysis of methods for enforcing locality and compositionality or (2) shift the focus of the paper to more focused on analysis and evaluation and weaken the claims that their model exhibits locality and compositionality, as there is not enough evidence to tell whether their method for enforcing locality and compositionality is the best way of doing so.	I-Review	I-3	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Strengths:[line_break_token]- The paper is well-motivated and tackles an important problem.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token]- The empirical evaluation is extensive.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token]- The framework of not relying on pretrained features is a novel contribution.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weaknesses:[line_break_token]- There does not seem to be a comparison between a compositional model and a non-compositional model in section 5.3.	B-Review	B-1	Review	656
Would the authors be able to provide such an analysis?	I-Review	I-1	Review	656
Otherwise it is difficult to tell exactly how and to what extent compositionality helps.	I-Review	I-1	Review	656
[line_break_token]- I would have assumed that enforcing locality should actually be a problem of *ignoring* information, rather than *predicting* labeled information.	B-Review	B-2	Review	656
However, the auxiliary loss introduction in section 4.1 only seems to enforce that local features (which by default are local from the CNN) are predictive of attributes/class, rather than enforcing that these features ignore information that is not local to the particular image patch they are modeling.	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
Would the authors be able to comment on this point, as well as provide an empirical analysis of how *unpredictive* the features of their model are on image patches elsewhere?	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
e thank the reviewer for the positive comments.	O	O	Reply	656
In what follows, we will attempt to address their remarks.	O	O	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Your concerns are completely fair, and I think the issue is that we didn't make it clear enough that the paper is an evaluation paper (and we can correct that).	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	656
Rather, the methods we introduce are all meant to be different tools we felt would test / evaluate the effect of compositionality and locality.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	656
It is true that the paper would have benefited from trying more local / compositional methods, but we think that as establishing a framework for discussing generalization in ZSL, our work has high value, and we hope that future works explore these factors in more depth under ZFS.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Comments on section 5.3.	O	O	Reply	656
The perspective we have taken in this work is to consider most CNN-based architectures to be compositional in one way or another (given that they arise from combining part representations e.g. feature maps).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	656
In this context, it is complicated to introduce a non-compositional model, as it would require a different architecture, hence the use of the TRE proxy and reasoning in terms of degrees of compositionality.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
Our second experiment in that section (fig.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
6) is an attempt to contrast a more compositional model (averaging part representations) with an ensemble (averaging predictions).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Comments on ‚Äúignoring‚Äù information.	O	O	Reply	656
We agree that a good criteria for a local representation would be that it ignores information from e.g. other patches.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	656
This fits with our proposed definition of a local representation as one that contains information specific to a patch.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
The reasoning behind the local losses was that as a local feature can only at best be predictive of the class information or attribute information that is present at the given location, the loss would encourage the model to account for this local information.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
An example would be: a patch corresponding to the beak of a bird cannot predict the tail color, but having an AC loss will encourage it to take into account beak shape, and color.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
One way to evaluate whether a local representation ignores local information is to estimate the mutual information between different local features corresponding to the same image.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
 We are working on evaluating this across models and datasets.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656

The paper proposes an evaluation framework for Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) methods called zero-shot learning from scratch (ZFS) where the model is not allowed to be pretrained on other datasets such as ImageNet.	O	O	Review	656
The main motivation of this approach is that it is difficult to understand what is useful for generalization in ZSL since most state-of-the-art methods use features pretrained on large datasets such as ImageNet.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token]Most state-of-the-art approaches exploit models pretrained on ImageNet.	O	O	Review	656
Instead, the paper proposes to randomly initialize model parameters to have a better understanding of what's happening in ZSL.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token]ZFS adds one constraint: model parameters should not contain information about data outside that from the training split of the target dataset.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token]Two main criteria are studied to study neural networks:[line_break_token]- compositionality (ability to be expressed as a combination of simpler parts)[line_break_token]- locality (ability to encode only information specific to locations of interest)[line_break_token]To provide a better understanding of their claims, the authors use MTurk annotations to construct boolean map for each local part labelled in the CUB dataset.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Although the paper is experimental, I vote for borderline accept for the following reasons:[line_break_token]- The paper is well-written and the contributions are clear.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token]- The evaluation metrics to evaluate how models generalize for both criteria are well motivated theoretically (e.g. Tree Reconstruction Error is used to evaluate compositionality), and different types of encoders (e.g. variations of DCGANS) are studied.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token]- The analysis of models pretrained in different contexts (e.g. supervised classification, reconstruction etc...), with only global or local information, and their impact on generalization is clear (see conclusion for a summary of results).	O	O	Review	656
Some conclusions are very intuitive but useful to know (e.g. VAEs and reconstruction models are not well suited to learn representations that generalize in ZFS).	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]The weaknesses I found in the paper are the following:[line_break_token]- The paper claims that the models used are smaller than the ‚Äústandard‚Äù backbones common in state-of-the-art Imagenet-pretrained ZSL methods.	B-Review	B-1	Review	656
However, few-shot learning method (e.g. ProtoNet) do not retrain the whole model: Protonet freezes most layers and fine-tunes only the last layers to avoid overfitting.	I-Review	I-1	Review	656
[line_break_token]- The paper introduces "Class-Matching Deep Informax (CMDIM)" which draws positive samples from other images from the same class to extract information that discriminative between categories instead of individual samples.	B-Review	B-2	Review	656
However, I did not understand its exact formulation and how it is exactly different from other DIM approaches.	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
[line_break_token]	O	O	Review	656
hank you for your thorough and helpful review.	O	O	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding the encoder backbone, we do freeze the pre-trained encoder when training Protonet, as you have indicated is common practice in ZSL studies.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	656
We apologize that this was not clear, and we clarified this for future readers in the revision by adding information to section 4.5.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
Our comment on the size of the encoders was only meant to hedge against any readers who might feel the results were too low compared to Imagenet-pretrained results from larger architectures (an example of such an improvement due to the size of the encoder is [1]).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We also clarified CMDIM in our revision, and this can be found in section G of the appendix.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	656
To clarify here: CMDIM only differs from DIM / AMDIM in that positive samples are drawn from a mixture of patches from the same image and other images with the same label.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
As such, CMDIM is not strictly self-supervised, as one reviewer notes, and this can be thought of as training the model to be good at retrieving patches from a query with the same label.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
We added CMDIM following our observations in Section 5.2 to improve the ability of DIM to recognize similar parts between different images.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656

[line_break_token]For hotpotqa, It could also have been interesting to evaluate the method of the distractor ones.	B-Review	B-1	Review	656

Summary[line_break_token]========[line_break_token]This paper introduces a graph-based recurrent retrieval model for retrieving evidence documents in a multi-hop reasoning question answering task.	O	O	Review	656
The main idea is that (1) the graph formed by Wikipedia links between passages can be used as constraint for constructing reasoning chains, and (2) the joint encoding of the question and current passage can be used to retrieve a subsequent passage in the reasoning chain.	O	O	Review	656
The paper describes a model for implementing the above retrieval system, and how they jointly train with a reading comprehension model.	O	O	Review	656
They demonstrate the effectiveness of the system on HotPotQA, showing improvements over previously published models, and SQuaD-Open, showing competitive results.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall Comments[line_break_token]===============[line_break_token]The paper is an interesting, but incremental, improvement to the area of question answering.	O	O	Review	656
Overall, there are two main concerns about this work.	B-Review	B-2	Review	656
First, while the results are somewhat strong, the ideas presented are small variations on existing systems.	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
For example, Godbole et al 2019 and Ding et al 2019 both explore using graphical structural to constraint iterative, multi-hop, retrieval.	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
Also, Feldman et al 2019, describe an encoder based approach to encode question and paragraph context for iterative retrieval.	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
Asides from smaller modeling differences (choice of RNN, training regime, BERT reader, etc.)	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
to account for the difference in results, the main difference seems to be the joint training of the retrieval system with the reader.	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
Secondly, the paper lacks clarity on some formal definitions and definition of the graph, making it hard to understand the content precisely.	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Detailed Comments[line_break_token]================[line_break_token]Below are some detailed comments about specific parts of the paper, in order of importance:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	656

We have substantially updated our manuscript to address all the concerns you kindly raised as much as we can.	O	O	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]First of all, we would like to address the two weaknesses you mention in your overall comments.	O	O	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Originality.	O	O	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]# On the difference with other graph-based approaches[line_break_token]Our work has several significant originalities in its system design, training and inference time strategies from Ding et al (2019) and Godbole et al (2019), which leads to more than 20 point improvements over these previous approaches on HotpotQA full wiki.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1)  System design: We formulate the retrieval as reasoning path search over the Wikipedia graph, instead of dynamically constructing an entity-graph for each question based on compiled document lists as in the previous work; the recurrent module dynamically updates and expands candidate paragraphs from the initial TF-IDF-based candidates at each time step.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
In addition, our work also studies the interplay between our retrieval model and the reader model (See the response of ‚ÄúReasoning path retrieval and the interplay between our reader and retriever‚Äù below for details).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) Training strategy: To train our recurrent module to learn to retrieve the path, leveraging the graph structure, we train our model with negative sampling and multiple reference paths (See Section 3.1.2 and the summary by review#1).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) Inference strategy: We introduce beam-search based decoding to make the framework more scalable (See Section 3.1.1; also summarized by review#1 and #2), and the beam search with our reasoning path re-ranking is more effective than a greedy search.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
As in Table 6, replacing beam search with greedy search deteriorates F1 by 3.7.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
Also, our method does not need to encode all possible nodes like the previous studies, and instead each path only encodes its corresponding paragraphs.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The HotpotQA dataset used in the previous work is based on introductory paragraphs only.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
By contrast, our method is applied not only to HotpotQA but also to the Natural Questions (See Update 1) and SQuAD Open datasets.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
These two datasets are not restricted to the introductory paragraphs, and our method achieves state-of-the-art results.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
This is made possible by our search-based decoding strategy.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
One interesting observation on our Natural Questions experiments is that our model learns to retrieve multi-hop reasoning paths with our training strategy, even without multi-hop gold path annotations as in HotpotQA (See Appendix C.5 and Table 13).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
This demonstrates the robustness and scalability of our approach.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	656
 [line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]# On the difference with other multi-step retrieval approaches[line_break_token]Previous multi-step approaches such as Das et al (2019), Qi et al (2019), Godbole et al (2019) and Feldman and El-Yaniv (2019) do not accommodate arbitrary steps of reasoning.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	656
As review#1 and review#3 summarize, our RNN approach uses the EOE symbol to produce reasoning paths with different lengths.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
This allows our model to be easily applicable to both multi-hop and single-hop questions without specifically changing the model architecture.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
Table 8 demonstrates the effectiveness of this adaptive retrieval process.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
In practice, it is not obvious if a question requires single-hop or multi-hop retrieval (e.g., some of the Natural Questions Open are clearly answerable based on single paragraph, while in some questions, multi-hop reasoning helps.),	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
and thus this flexibility is another significant advantage.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]# Reasoning path retrieval and the interplay between our reader and retriever [line_break_token]Our framework benefits from the interplay between our retriever and reader.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	656
Our retriever encodes the candidate paragraphs independently for scalability, and iteratively selects a paragraph at each time step conditioned by the prediction history.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	656
Each of the resulting K reasoning paths (K=beam size) includes one or more paragraphs.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	656
Our reader encodes the paragraphs in the paths jointly and predicts probabilities of each reasoning path E containing an answer span.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	656
By encoding the paragraphs jointly, our reader model fully leverages the self-attention mechanism across the concatenated paragraphs in the retrieved reasoning paths; this is especially crucial for multi-hop reasoning as discussed in recent work (Wang et al 2019a).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	656
The additional reasoning path re-ranking makes our overall framework robust, leading to large performance improvement (See Section 4.4 and Table 8,9).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	656
This reasoning path re-ranking is one of the novel points in our work.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]These significant differences together demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the four experimental settings in the three datasets, HotpotQA (full wiki, distractor), SQuAD Open and Natural Questions Open (Update 1).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	656
Notably, our method outperforms all the previous graph-based or multi-step retrieval methods by more than 20 points on HotpotQA full wiki and 15 points on SQuAD Open (See Table 1,2,3).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We added discussions in Section 2 (Related Work) to clarify these points.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	656

This paper proposes a method to find a sequence of reasoning paragraphs in Wikipedia to answer queries requiring multi-hop reasoning.	O	O	Review	656
They make the key observation that answering multi-hop queries might require retrieving evidence that have very less lexical overlap with the question.	O	O	Review	656
Given a query, the proposed method starts from a set of initial paragraphs retrieved by a tf-idf retriever and uses the outgoing Wikipedia anchor link to hop to the next evidence.	O	O	Review	656
They propose a simple recurrent neural network that takes in the current paragraph (and the hidden state) and decide which paragraph to hop to in the next step.	O	O	Review	656
Because of the available supervision for the paragraphs (in HotpotQA), they can train a supervised path selector.	O	O	Review	656
They also add a special EoE token that denotes the end of the reasoning path, thereby having the ability to produce reasoning paths of different lengths.	O	O	Review	656
After training the retriever a beam of reasoning paths is sent to the reader module.	O	O	Review	656
The reader module re-ranks the reasoning paths again and then use a standard BERTQA model and the top re-ranked chain of paragraphs to find the evidence.	O	O	Review	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, the paper presents a well-designed system for handling multi-hop queries and the explicit recurrent state is a nice contribution and addition to the IR model proposed in Godbole et al 2019.	O	O	Review	656
The paper is clearly written for the most part.	O	O	Review	656

[line_break_token]‚Äî The paper is clearly written and was straightforward to follow[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weaknesses:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	656
 The paper mentions that it studies the interplay between the retriever and reader.	B-Review	B-1	Review	656
It is unclear how it is doing so, since the retriever and the reader are not explicitly interacting with each other.	I-Review	I-1	Review	656
Cant the retriever and the reader be trained separately?	I-Review	I-1	Review	656
[line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	656
 It is unclear / not motivated, why there is an extra step of re-ranking required in the reading stage?	B-Review	B-2	Review	656
In other words, what kinds of extra inductive bias is this additional step of re-ranking providing since the same kind of supervision was used while training the retriever model.	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
I do note that the ablation study is helpful and it is clear that it is effective, but it would be nice to see a discussion regarding why this second step of re-ranking helps.	I-Review	I-2	Review	656
[line_break_token]3.	B-Review	B-5	Review	656
Since the reader model (BERT reader) takes the top scoring chain of paragraphs concatenated together, that would imply that it is currently limited by the number of positional embeddings in the BERT model (512 tokens).	B-Review	B-3	Review	656
I think this limitation should be explicitly mentioned and possible remedies discussed.	I-Review	I-3	Review	656
[line_break_token]4.	B-Review	B-7	Review	656
The current approach is heavily dependent on Wikipedia graph and will not work if the hyperlink graph is not provided.	B-Review	B-4	Review	656
It would have been nice to have an entity linker component that could also create the graph structure.	I-Review	I-4	Review	656
I believe concurrent work such as Godbole et al 2019 has addressed this and the paper should mention this while contrasting with their work.	I-Review	I-4	Review	656
[line_break_token]5.	O	O	Review	656
From figure 2, I got an impression that since the reader scored the span in "Top 2 reasoning path‚Äù higher, that was selected.	B-Review	B-5	Review	656
But after section 3.2, I was left confused because it looks like the reader model consumes the top scoring chain after the second stage of re-ranking.	I-Review	I-5	Review	656
This is not clear from the figure and should be fixed.	I-Review	I-5	Review	656
[line_break_token]6.	O	O	Review	656
Discussion on scalability: Although the retriever is clearly very effective for such questions, the running time would be prohibitive (for open domain QA) as at test time, query dependent context representations is constructed for each of the paragraph in the reasoning chain.

I would like to see a discussion / some running time comparison where query independent paragraph representations are constructed and the network just encodes the query independently at test time.	I-Review	I-6	Review	656

[line_break_token][line_break_token]To show the importance of the query-dependent encodings in terms of accuracy, we conducted an experiment again with a query-independent variant of our approach on the HotpotQA development set.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	656
More specifically, our retriever model encodes paragraphs independently from their corresponding queries and sequentially retrieves paragraphs in the same manner as our proposed approach.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
For a fair comparison, we use the same reader model (BERT wwm) with the path re-ranking.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
We train the alternative model without using the data augmentation technique for quick experiments.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
For evaluation, we provide results on both the distractor and full wiki settings.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The results are summarized in the table below:    [line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]  encoding method   | full wiki QA F1  | full wiki QA EM  | distractor QA F1  | distractor QA EM [line_break_token]--------------------------   |----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------[line_break_token] query-dependent     |          64.1           |         52.6             |           81.2              |           68.0 [line_break_token] query-independent |          47.3            |         37.8             |           80.0              |           66.4  [line_break_token][line_break_token]For our query-dependent approach, the full wiki results correspond to ‚Äúretriever, no link-based negatives‚Äù in Table 6, and the distractor results correspond to ‚ÄúOurs (Reader: BERT wwm)‚Äù Table 1.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
As seen in this table, the QA F1 and EM performance significantly deteriorate on the full wiki setting, which demonstrates the importance of the query-dependent encoding for complex and entity-centric open-domain question answering.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
This is the reason why we employ our query-dependent approach, and we achieve competitive results on the three datasets.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We also found that the performance drop on the distractor setting is much smaller than that on the full wiki setting.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
This is due to its closed nature.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
In the distractor setting, we are given ten paragraphs and the two gold paragraphs are always included, which makes the retrieval task much easier than that in the full wiki setting.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
We have only 10 paragraphs for each question, and thus the number of the possible reasoning paths is quite limited.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
Therefore, our recurrent retriever model is likely to discover the gold reasoning paths by the beam search, and our reader model can select the gold paths by the robust re-ranking approach.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
To verify this assumption, we checked the P EM score as a retrieval accuracy in the distractor setting.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
If we only consider the top-1 path from the beam search, the P EM score of the query-independent model is 12% lower than that of our query-dependent model.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
However, if we consider all the reasoning paths produced by the beam search, the coverage of the gold paths is almost the same.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
As a result, our reader model can perform similarly with both the query-dependent/independent approaches.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
This additionally shows the robustness of our re-ranking approach.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We are planning to add these experimental results in our next revision.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	656

Given a depth image of the scene, we can generate a reconstruction of the scene in 3D, even if it is partial/imperfect.	I-Review	I-1	Review	64
Direct reasoning in 3D should now be possible instead of going via deep networks as proposed in the paper.	I-Review	I-1	Review	64
I believe a direct 3D approach would make a meaningful baseline at the very least and needs to be discussed.	I-Review	I-1	Review	64
[line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	64
The authors use a pre-trained RGB-to-Depth network trained on NYU-v2 to predict depth for the images of VRD and VG.	B-Review	B-2	Review	64
There is very little discussion about the quality of predicted depth maps.	I-Review	I-2	Review	64
Ideally, this needs to be quantified to convince the reader that the generated depth maps are "good" but at the very least the authors need to show qualitative examples (both good, typical and bad) to prove that the pre-trained network generates meaningful depth maps.	I-Review	I-2	Review	64
[line_break_token]3.	B-Review	B-4	Review	64
To use a siamese (shared weights) feature extractor between RGB and Depth images or not, is not a significant contribution by itself.	B-Review	B-3	Review	64

However, in Section 3.2, under RGB Feature Extraction and Depth Map Feature Extraction, the discussion is about VGG-16 and AlexNet-BN networks.	I-Review	I-4	Review	64
The VGG-16 network is pre-trained in ImageNet and finetuned to relevant data but it is not clear for what task?	B-Review	B-5	Review	64
If the task is object detection, it needs to be trained for it (not fine-tuned, unless it is being initialized from COCO pre-training).	I-Review	I-5	Review	64
The AlexNet-BN depth model is trained for relation detection using only depth.	B-Review	B-6	Review	64
But it is not clear if it is using proposals/boxes generated by RGB detection model or using ground-truth boxes.	I-Review	I-6	Review	64

You are right that direct reasoning in 3D would be more beneficial.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	64
However, to reconstruct a scene in 3D we would need to collect either 1) more than one RGB image or 2) more than one depth map, coming from different views of that scene.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	64
This is a more involved process that has limitations both on data and computation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	64
What we have in our scenario is only one RGB image from the scene which we use to synthetically generate the depth map from.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	64
Going through the RGB-to-Depth deep network in our architecture is the only way to acquire those depth maps in first place.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	64
Other than the limitation in our current datasets, please note that in many real-world scenarios for humans (or for autonomous agents such as self-driving cars) this is a similar case: a car driving directly forward towards a pedestrian has no access to the rear-view of that person.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]********* Post Rebuttal *********[line_break_token][line_break_token]I appreciate the authors' effort in providing thorough responses and revised manuscript.	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I agree with the authors that "the finding not being surprising" is not a ground for rejection.	O	O	Review	64
I tried to word my final decision carefully but it seems it has still caused confusion for the authors.	O	O	Review	64
As I have mentioned in my original review, the rating was a result of the 4 points considered *together* .	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token][line_break_token]That is, if one exploits privileged information that needs extra sensory data and/or annotation (point 2), *and*, this privileged information is clearly related and thus should be normally useful for the final task (point 1), *and* achieve marginal improvements (point 3), it can be a ground for rejection.	O	O	Review	64
Especially, given that prior works with similar arguments exists (point 4).	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The rebuttal has alleviated the issue of marginal improvements (point 3) by introducing meanR@K (or as the revised paper refer to it, Macro R@K).	O	O	Review	64
Here, the improvements are more significant both compared to the state of the art and ablated baselines.	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors also argue that the related [Yang et al 2018] paper (point 4) should be considered a concurrent submission since the authors original submission was to AAAI18.	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The rebuttal also addresses other clarity or experimental issues which improves the quality of the revised work.	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally, I understand that the privileged information is only required during training time which is a good point.	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token][line_break_token]All in all, *assuming that [Yang et al 2018] is considered a concurrent work* according to ICLR, I think the revised paper becomes slightly above borderline and thus I change my rating to "weak accept".	O	O	Review	64
If [Yang et al 2018] is not considered concurrent work, then, a conclusive comparison is required for the acceptance of the current work.	B-Review	B-11	Review	64
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]********* Summary *********[line_break_token] [line_break_token]The paper poses the question of whether depth information is informative for visual relationship prediction using still images.	O	O	Review	64
It is intuitive that 3D arrangement of objects in an image can be a useful cue for predicting their relationship.	O	O	Review	64
As such it is important to see whether and to what extent depth information complements RGB information for visual relation detection.	O	O	Review	64
That is the focus of this paper.	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token]The paper proposes to use an off-the-shelf monocular depth estimation networks to augment the available RGB information towards better visual relation detection.	O	O	Review	64
For that, it proposes a specific network two-stream structure working on RGB image and (predicted) depth image.	O	O	Review	64
The proposed model demonstrates improved results upon state of the art for visual relation prediction.	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token] [line_break_token][line_break_token]********* Strengths and Weaknesses *********[line_break_token] [line_break_token]+ A comprehensive set of tests has been conducted.	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token]+ Zero-shot prediction results are particularly interesting.	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token]+ The experiment on ranking the predicate classes based on the change in prediction accuracy before and after using depth information (Figure 4) is interesting and intuitive.	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token]* The final results improve upon the state-of-the-art, especially on the zero-shot learning regime.	B-Review	B-4	Review	64
However, it seems that the improvement is mainly coming from the new architecture as opposed to the inclusion of the depth information.	I-Review	I-4	Review	64
That is, ours_{c,v,l} brings most of the improvement already the last step to ours_{c,v,l,d} is negligible for non-zero-shot case.	I-Review	I-4	Review	64
[line_break_token]- Along the same line, it‚Äôs possible that this small difference between ours_{c,v,l} and ours_{c,v,l,d} for the standard predicate prediction, can be due to a hyper-parameter optimization that is (only or more thoroughly) done for ours_{c,v,l,d}. The hyper-parameter optimization scheme for different baselines is not described.	B-Review	B-5	Review	64
[line_break_token]- Given the small difference of ablation levels, the comparison will be stronger if done multiple times and reporting mean and standard deviation of the results.	B-Review	B-6	Review	64
[line_break_token]- For a fair comparison the visual feature vector v_{so} should be tried as the feature of the union bound box of both subject and object same way as it is done for depth feature vector d_{so}. [line_break_token]- The paper refers to ‚ÄúOurs-d‚Äô_{so}‚Äù as a baseline that *only* uses depth information with no image/label information.	B-Review	B-7	Review	64
However, it seems that the region proposals for this feature are coming from the image-based network that uses image information.	B-Review	B-8	Review	64
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]- Important related but uncited works:[line_break_token](1) [‚ÄúVisual Relationship Prediction via Label Clustering and Incorporation of Depth Information‚Äù ECCV workshops 2018] studies the same question as part of their work.	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token] [line_break_token][line_break_token]********* Final Decision *********[line_break_token] [line_break_token]I do not find the paper passing the acceptance bar mainly due to the following reasons together:[line_break_token]1) The finding is not surprising since most of the visual relations are either explicitly depth-related (e.g., behind) or are semantically constrained by depth (e.g. riding cannot happen at different depths when the image is taken orthogonal to the rider).	O	O	Review	64
[line_break_token]2) an additional depth dataset is used which provides the model with privileged information.	B-Review	B-9	Review	64
Should it have been the case that depth information were inferred without an additional offline dataset, the results would have been more interesting.	I-Review	I-9	Review	64
[line_break_token]3) the improvements due to the additional depth network are not significant or conclusive.	I-Review	I-9	Review	64
[line_break_token]4) there is a prior uncited work with the same research question for effectiveness of depth information in visual relation detection which uses a similar approach.	I-Review	I-9	Review	64
[line_break_token] [line_break_token][line_break_token]********* Minor points *********[line_break_token][line_break_token]- the code is not available.	B-Review	B-10	Review	64
This is especially important since the paper is outperforming prior works which could be a contribution if reproducible.	I-Review	I-10	Review	64
[line_break_token]- Section 2.2: is l_{so} concatenation of l_s and l_o?	I-Review	I-10	Review	64

[line_break_token]- Why VGG network for visual feature and AlexNet for depth features?	I-Review	I-10	Review	64
[line_break_token]- zero-shot learning results on visual genome is missing[line_break_token]- training procedure is a bit unclear: the text suggest that the fine tuning and/or learning of the three components might happen separately.	I-Review	I-10	Review	64
It is important to clearly state if they are done in an end-to-end fashion and simultaneously or separately; and why.	I-Review	I-10	Review	64
[line_break_token]- It‚Äôs good to name the method in table 2 in the same fashion as table 1.	I-Review	I-10	Review	64
With the current naming (based on architecture) it is a bit confusing to understand the content without additional cross referencing.	I-Review	I-10	Review	64
For instance AlexNet-BN - Raw seems to correspond to Ours_{c,v,l,d}[line_break_token]- Figure 4: the frequency represented as different shades of red or blue is really hard to notice especially on a printed paper.	I-Review	I-10	Review	64
The red vs blue color coding is not necessary since the bars going up or down indicate the same quality.	I-Review	I-10	Review	64
So, it might be better to use red/blue for frequency instead (e.g. dark red high frequency to dark blue low frequency)[line_break_token]- Section 3.2: the AlexNet reference seems wrong, it should be "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" NIPS , 2012[line_break_token]- The structure of section 3.5 is currently flat while the content seems to be nested (two experiments and two sets of corresponding discussions).

[line_break_token] [line_break_token] [line_break_token]********* Points of extensions (improvement) *********[line_break_token][line_break_token]- I believe *unsupervised* discovery of depth information for visual relation detection can be an interesting direction since it is not limited to the availability of relevant depth dataset.

The paper is an extension of the matching networks by Vinyals et al in NIPS2016.	O	O	Review	414
Instead of using all the examples in the support set during test, the method represents each class by the mean of its learned embeddings.	O	O	Review	414
The training procedure and experimental setting are very similar to the original matching networks.	B-Review	B-1	Review	414
I am not completely sure about its advantages over the original matching networks.	I-Review	I-1	Review	414
It seems to me when dealing with 1-shot case, these two methods are identical since there is only one example seen in this class, so the mean of the embedding is the embedding itself.	B-Review	B-2	Review	414
When dealing with 5-shot case, original matching networks compute the weighted average of all examples, but it is at most 5x cost.	I-Review	I-2	Review	414
The experimental results reported for prototypical nets are only slightly better than matching networks.	B-Review	B-3	Review	414
I  think it is a simple, straightforward,  novel extension, but I am not fully convinced its advantages.	I-Review	I-3	Review	414
We thank Reviewer 2 for reviewing our paper.	O	O	Reply	414
This review‚Äôs main criticism is that our approach is too similar to the matching networks model proposed by Vinyals et al 2016.	O	O	Reply	414
We will update the related work section of our paper to clarify the relationship between prototypical networks and matching nets.	O	O	Reply	414
In the meantime, we would like to take this opportunity to elaborate upon some of the benefits of our approach relative to matching networks: better computational efficiency, a simpler form for the classifier, and a straightforward extension to the zero-shot setting.	O	O	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]First and foremost, prototypical networks are computationally more efficient than matching networks.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	414
If there are K classes, each with N support examples, then computing distances for a query point will take O(K) time for prototypical networks vs. O(KN) for matching networks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	414
This is indeed a 5x speedup for the 5-shot scenario, which though not enormous is also not insignificant.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	414
Even slightly larger scales such as N=10 or N=100 would lead to useful performance gains.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	414
We see favorable applications of our approach to tasks such as document tagging where it is important to quickly label new documents without needing to compute distances to multiple support examples per tag.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Second is the simpler expression of our classifier (see Section 3.2 of our paper) compared to the non-parametric form of matching networks.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	414
Not only does this require less storage (O(K) vs. O(KN)) but it also sets the stage for future work that explores the prediction of alternate classifiers beyond the linear ones we investigate here.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally, our approach affords a straightforward extension to the zero-shot setting that matching networks do not.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	414
The matching networks approach is fundamentally about embedding support examples whereas prototypical networks focuses on learning an embedded representation for each class.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	414
For the few-shot scenario we chose our representation to be the mean of embedded points, while for the zero-shot scenario we utilized the embedded metadata.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	414
Such a generalization of the matching networks approach to zero-shot classification does not exist	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	414

This paper proposes an improved version of matching networks, with better scalability properties with respect to the support set of a few-shot classifier.	O	O	Review	414
Instead of considering each support point individually, they learn an embedding function that aggregates over items of each class within the support set (eq.	O	O	Review	414
1).	O	O	Review	414
This is combined with episodic few-shot training with randomly-sampled partitions of the training set classes, so that the training and testing scenarios match closely.	O	O	Review	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Although the idea is quite straightforward, and there are a great many prior works on zero-shot and few-shot learning, the proposed technique is novel to my knowledge, and achieves state-of-the-art results on several  benchmark datasets.	O	O	Review	414

This work of learning metric learning propose to simplify an earlier work (matching network) which is a great objective.	O	O	Review	414
However, I am not sure it achieve better results than matching networks.	B-Review	B-1	Review	414
The space of learning embeddings to optimize nearest neighbor classification has been explored before, but the idea of averaging the propotypes is interesting (as a non-linear extension of Mensink et al 2013).	I-Review	I-1	Review	414
I would suggest to improve the discussion of related work and to consolidate the results section to help distinguish between the methods you outperform and the one you do not.	I-Review	I-1	Review	414

The learning to rank (for websearch) litterature with triplet supervision or global ranking losses is also highly relevant, ie.	I-Review	I-2	Review	414
one example "the query" defines the class and the embedding space need to be such that positive/relevant document are closer to the query than the others.	I-Review	I-2	Review	414

The paper discusses the problem of optimizing neural networks with hard threshold and proposes a novel solution to it.	O	O	Review	414
The problem is of significance because in many applications one requires deep networks which uses reduced computation and limited energy.	O	O	Review	414
The authors frame the problem of optimizing such networks to fit the training data as a convex combinatorial problems.	O	O	Review	414
However since the complexity of such a problem is exponential, the authors propose a collection of heuristics/approximations to solve the problem.	O	O	Review	414
These include, a heuristic for setting the targets at each layer, using a soft hinge loss, mini-batch training and such.	O	O	Review	414
Using these modifications the authors propose an algorithm (Algorithm 2 in appendix) to train such models efficiently.	O	O	Review	414
They compare the performance of a bunch of models trained by their algorithm against the ones trained using straight-through-estimator (SSTE) on a couple of datasets, namely, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.	O	O	Review	414
They show superiority of their algorithm over SSTE.	O	O	Review	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I thought the paper is very well written and provides a really nice exposition of the problem of training deep networks with hard thresholds.	O	O	Review	414
The authors formulation of the problem as one of combinatorial optimization and proposing Algorithm 1 is also quite interesting.	O	O	Review	414
The results are moderately convincing in favor of the proposed approach.	O	O	Review	414
Though a disclaimer here is that I'm not 100% sure that SSTE is the state of the art for this problem.	B-Review	B-5	Review	414
Overall i like the originality of the paper and feel that it has a potential of reasonable impact within the research community.	O	O	Review	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]There are a few flaws/weaknesses in the paper though, making it somewhat lose.	O	O	Review	414
[line_break_token]- The authors start of by posing the problem as a clean combinatorial optimization problem and propose Algorithm 1.	B-Review	B-1	Review	414
Realizing the limitations of the proposed algorithm, given the assumptions under which it was conceived in, the authors relax those assumptions in the couple of paragraphs before section 3.1 and pretty much throw away all the nice guarantees, such as checks for feasibility, discussed earlier.	I-Review	I-1	Review	414
[line_break_token]- The result of this is another algorithm (I guess the main result of the paper), which is strangely presented in the appendix as opposed to the main text, which has no such guarantees.	B-Review	B-2	Review	414
 [line_break_token]- There is no theoretical proof that the heuristic for setting the target is a good one, other than a rough intuition[line_break_token]- The authors do not discuss at all the impact on generalization ability of the model trained using the proposed approach.	B-Review	B-3	Review	414
The entire discussion revolves around fitting the training set and somehow magically everything seem to generalize and not overfit.	B-Review	B-4	Review	414

We respond to each of your questions and comments below.	O	O	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Based on the quantization literature and other hard-threshold papers that we looked at and cited, SSTE is (by far) the most widely used method.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	414
It‚Äôs true that there are many variations of the straight-through estimator (STE), but we compare to the main one (SSTE), and don‚Äôt know of any that outperform SSTE.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	414
Note that neither STE nor SSTE has convergence guarantees (they‚Äôre biased estimators) but SSTE at least works well in practice.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While we agree that it would be nice to have better guarantees for FTPROP-MB, it is typical in AI and combinatorial search (as you likely know) to start from a theoretically-justified approach and then use that to define a more heuristic approach that sacrifices those guarantees in favor of efficiently achieving the desired property (i.e., feasibility), as we do here.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	414
Since the problem we are solving is NP-complete and (most likely) hard to approximate, heuristics are unavoidable.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	414
By using the (soft) hinge loss at each layer, FTPROP-MB is implicitly trying to maximize ‚Äúsoft feasibility‚Äù of the network because of the correspondence between the hinge loss and margin maximization.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Further, while feasibility is important for understanding the solution we propose, giving it up is necessary to avoid overfitting.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	414
This is similar to the linear-separability property of the perceptron where the robust method for learning a perceptron is to use a hinge loss instead of the perceptron criterion.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	414
 We intend to further study the properties of FTPROP and (soft) feasibility in the future.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We did not put the FTPROP-MB pseudocode in the main paper because it‚Äôs such a simple algorithm and we were running short on space, but we can move it to the main body.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Space limitations also precluded further discussions of generalization ability.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	414
We used standard approaches to avoid overfitting (L2 regularization, mini-batching, hinge vs. perceptron criterion, etc.),	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	414
which we mention in the paper (but can make more clear) and which account for the good generalization performance	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	414

The paper studies learning in deep neural networks with hard activation functions, e.g. step functions like sign(x).	O	O	Review	414
Of course, backpropagation is difficult to adapt to such networks, so prior work has considered different approaches.	O	O	Review	414
Arguably the most popular is straight-through estimation (Hinton 2012, Bengio et al 2013), in which the activation functions are simply treated as identity functions during backpropagation.	O	O	Review	414
More recently, a new type of straight-through estimation, saturated STE (Hubara et al 2016) uses 1[|z|<1] as the derivative of sign(z).	O	O	Review	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper generalizes saturated STE by recognizing that other discrete targets of each activation layer can be chosen.	O	O	Review	414
Deciding on these targets is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem.	O	O	Review	414
Once the targets are chosen, updating the weights of each layer to minimize the loss on those targets is a convex optimization.	O	O	Review	414
The targets are heuristically updated through the layers, starting out the output using the proposed feasibility target propagation.	O	O	Review	414
At each layer, the targets can be chosen using a variety of search algorithms such as beam search.	O	O	Review	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experiments show that FTP often outperforms saturated STE on CIFAR and ImageNet with sign and quantized activation functions, reaching levels of performance closer to the full-precision activation networks.	O	O	Review	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper's ideas are very interesting, exploring an alternative training method to backpropagation that supports hard-threshold activation functions.	O	O	Review	414
The experimental results are encouraging, though I have a few questions below that prevent me for now from rating the paper higher.	O	O	Review	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Comments and questions:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) How computationally expensive is FTP?	B-Review	B-1	Review	414
The experiments using ResNet indicate it is not prohibitively expensive, but I am eager for more details.	I-Review	I-1	Review	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) Does (Hubara et al 2016) actually compare their proposed saturated STE with the orignal STE on any tasks?	B-Review	B-2	Review	414
I do not see a comparison.	I-Review	I-2	Review	414
If that is so, should this paper also compare with STE?	I-Review	I-2	Review	414
How do we know if generalizing saturated STE is more worthwhile than generalizing STE?	I-Review	I-2	Review	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) It took me a while to understand the authors' subtle comparison with target propagation, where they say "Our framework can be viewed as an instance of target propagation that uses combinatorial optimization to set discrete targets, whereas previous approaches employed continuous optimization."	B-Review	B-3	Review	414
It seems that the difference is greater than explicitly stated, that prior target propagation used continuous optimization to set *continuous targets*. (One could imagine using continuous optimization to set discrete targets such as a convex relaxation of a constraint satisfaction problem.)	I-Review	I-3	Review	414
Focusing on discrete targets gains the benefits of quantized networks.	I-Review	I-3	Review	414
If I am understanding the novelty correctly, it would strengthen the paper to make this difference clear.	I-Review	I-3	Review	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4) On a related note, if feasible target propagation generalizes saturated straight through estimation, is there a connection between (continuous) target propagation and the original type of straight through estimation?	B-Review	B-4	Review	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]5) In Table 1, the significance of the last two columns is unclear.	B-Review	B-5	Review	414
It seems that ReLU and Saturated ReLU are included to show the performance of networks with full-precision activation functions (which is good).	I-Review	I-5	Review	414
I am unclear though on why they are compared against each other (bolding one or the other) and if there is some correspondence between those two columns and the other pairs, i.e., is ReLU some kind of analog of SSTE and Saturated ReLU corresponds to FTP-SH somehow?	I-Review	I-5	Review	414
Thank you for your review.	O	O	Reply	414
We respond to each of your questions below.	O	O	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) FTP-SH is no more expensive than backprop (in the same way that SSTE isn‚Äôt either, and SSTE is a special case of FTPROP-MB).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	414
The only added cost is that the soft hinge loss requires computing an exponential, which is slower than a max (i.e., the cost of computing a sigmoid vs. a ReLU), but this is a minor difference in compute time.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) In the experiments, Hubara et al (2016) does not compare SSTE and STE directly, but in the text of the paper they report that ‚ÄúNot [saturating] the gradient when [the input] is too large significantly worsens performance.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	414
‚Äù This is also what we found in preliminary experiments, where the unsaturated STE is significantly worse than STE.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	414
Note, however, that STE is also a special case of our framework where the loss function is just loss(z, t) = -zt, so we generalize that as well (and pretty much any type of STE can be obtained by choosing different losses in our framework).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) Yes, this is a good point and correct.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	414
We will update the paper to make this fact more clear.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	414
Thank you.	O	O	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4) It‚Äôs possible, although if so it‚Äôs not an obvious connection, and we haven‚Äôt studied this issue in detail yet.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	414
[line_break_token][line_break_token]5) Yes, good point.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	414
This is somewhat confusing, and we will clarify it in the paper and remove the bolding, since the goal isn‚Äôt really to compare them against each other (although it is mildly interesting that saturating the ReLU improves performance in some cases).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	414
There is no correspondence between those two columns and the other pairs; the formatting of the table is just unclear	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	414

* Summary:[line_break_token]The paper introduces a novel tensor decomposition that is reminiscent of canonical decomposition (CP) with low-rank factors, based on the observation that the core tensor in Tucker decomposition can be decomposed, resulting in a model interpolating between CP and Tucker.

This paper introduces few-shot learning for graph classification.	O	O	Review	20115
The authors propose a pre-training-&gt;fine-tuning approach to handle graph classes unseen at training time (and in only a few shots at test time).	O	O	Review	20115
[line_break_token][line_break_token]At a high level, and to my understanding, their method a priori generates the ingredients for a graph of graphs, a "super-graph", in two steps: first, it discovers a prototype graph for each graph class in the dataset, then it clusters the prototype graphs into a set of super-classes by k-NN.	O	O	Review	20115
Both of these operations rely on the spectral distance between graphs, defined in this work using the spectrum of a graph's normalized Laplacian matrix and the pth Wasserstein distance between probability measures.	O	O	Review	20115
The intuition is that the super-graph built from these ingredients helps model latent relations between graph classes; these relations can be used at test time to improve classification of unseen graph classes.	O	O	Review	20115
[line_break_token][line_break_token]During (pre-)training, the model builds super-graphs on each batch of data.	O	O	Review	20115
It uses super-graph information in two ways: an auxiliary classification head (an MLP called C^sup) is trained to map graph embeddings to their corresponding super-class labels, and the super-graph itself, whose nodes are embeddings for individual graphs in the batch, passes through a graph attention network (GAT) that outputs a base class for each graph -- this is the classification head C^GAT.	O	O	Review	20115
The graph embeddings themselves come from a feature extractor F_Œ∏ implemented as a graph isomorphism network (GIN).	O	O	Review	20115
[line_break_token][line_break_token]During the fine-tuning stage the model adapts to and classifies graphs from classes unseen during training.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20115
Here the parameters of the feature extractor GIN and the C^sup MLP are frozen.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20115
C^sup outputs a set of super-class labels that are used to construct a super-graph, which in turn feeds into C^GAT, which in turn yields labels for the test graphs.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20115
C^GAT (but not the GIN or C^sup) fine-tunes on a small number q of labelled examples of each novel test class.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20115
The full model is evaluated on unlabelled examples from the novel test classes.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20115
This process assumes that the novel test graph classes belong to the same set of super classes as the training graph classes, a point that is, unfortunately, not discussed.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20115
[line_break_token][line_break_token]There's a lot to digest in this paper, on both the technical and architectural sides.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20115
There are graphs of graphs (super-graphs) and different GNN variants operating on both, with the output of one graph network, the feature extracting GIN, feeding into another, the GAT classifier.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20115
Understanding all of these pieces and how they fit together is challenging for the reader: I got lost somewhat in the Classifier description in Section 4, while Section 3 defines many things and gives some math that might be extraneous.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20115
It is also not immediately obvious that fine-tuning takes place on the set G_N and testing on the set G_U. Overall, though, the paper became clear to me with time and I found the overall presentation to be good.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20115
Some additional figures that depict the super-graph construction and clustering would be useful.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20115
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The construction and use of the super-graph structure to model relations between graph classes is interesting and novel to me, though it relies on well-established techniques (Wasserstein barycenters, Lloyd's algorithm for k-NN).	B-Review	B-5	Review	20115
The architecture itself, which combines GINs and GATs, is also novel to me; a downside is that it is highly complex.	I-Review	I-5	Review	20115
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experiments were undertaken on two datasets and seem fairly thorough, with variance established on a high number of seeds (high in the deep learning literature).	B-Review	B-6	Review	20115
They demonstrate that the proposed method makes significant improvements over baselines.	I-Review	I-6	Review	20115
The baselines are somewhat limited because, as the authors state, "there do not exist any standard state-of-the-art methods for few-shot graph classification".	I-Review	I-6	Review	20115
However, I do not think the authors should be penalized for trying something new.	I-Review	I-6	Review	20115
On the other hand, given the novelty of the task, it would be nice to see an investigation/discussion of how few-shot graph learning differs from few-shot image learning (where there has been much more work).	I-Review	I-6	Review	20115
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I found the ablation and sensitivity studies illuminating, and I was pleased to see that the authors do support their claim that the super-graphs improve class separation over the feature extractor embeddings -- the GIN-k-NN baseline results provide evidence of this.	B-Review	B-7	Review	20115

The authors do not even describe in the paper what the graph classes in these datasets actually are or represent, which would be good to know.	I-Review	I-8	Review	20115

The learning process constitutes of the following steps.	O	O	Review	20115
First, the base class is classified into K super classes based on the spectral embedding of the graph (onto distributions over the corresponding graph spectrum) and the k-means algorithm with the Wasserstein metric.	O	O	Review	20115

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The meta-learning framework, where batches are sampled as ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù with N-way K-shot setting, does not perform as well in our few-shot setting on graphs for the following reasons:[line_break_token]1) We have very limited total number of training classes (in order of 10s), when compared to the image domain (order of 100s and 1000s).

Our architecture that jointly learns the superclass and regular class using two-phase (training and fine-tuning phase) training is also a novel construction.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20115

Summary[line_break_token][line_break_token]Learning embeddings of graphs in hyperbolic space have become popular and yielded promising results.	O	O	Review	705
A core reason for that is learning hierarchical representations of the graphs is easier in hyperbolic space due to the curvature and the geometrical properties of the hyperbolic space.	O	O	Review	705
Similar to [1, 2], this paper uses Lorentzian model of the hyperbolic space in order to learn embeddings of the graph.	O	O	Review	705
The main difference of the proposed approach in this paper is that  they come up with a closed-form solution such that each node representation close to the centroid of their descendants.	O	O	Review	705
A curious property of the equation for the centroids proposed to learn the embeddings of each node also encodes information related to the specificity in the Euclidean norm of the centroid.	O	O	Review	705
Also this paper introduces two additional hyperparameters.	O	O	Review	705
Beta hyperparameter is selected to control the curvature of the space.	O	O	Review	705
Depending on the task the optimal curvature can be tuned to be a different value.	O	O	Review	705
This also ties closely with the de-Sitter spaces.	O	O	Review	705
Authors provide results on different graph embedding benchmark tasks.	O	O	Review	705
The paper claims that, an advantage of the proposed approach is that the embedding of the model can be tuned with regular SGD without needing to use Riemannian optimization techniques.	O	O	Review	705

[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons[line_break_token]Experiments are only limited to small scale-traditional graph datasets.	B-Review	B-5	Review	705

-‚ÄúEq 11, bears lots of similarity to the Einstein gyro-midpoint‚Äù[line_break_token] [line_break_token]As mentioned in our introduction, there exist various hyperbolic geometries with corresponding distances: the Poincar√© distance, the Lorentzian distance and the gyrodistance [A,B]. W	O	O	Reply	705

The paper proposes a new approach to compute hyperbolic embeddings based on the squared Lorentzian distance.	O	O	Review	705
This choice of distance function is motivated by the observation that the ranking of these distances is equivalent to the ranking of the true hyperbolic distance (e.g., on the hyperboloid).	O	O	Review	705
For this reason, the paper proposes to use this distance function in combination with ranking losses as proposed by Nickel & Kiela (2017), as it might be easier to optimize.	O	O	Review	705
Moreover, the paper proposes to use Weierstrass coordinates as a representation for points on the hyperboloid.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Hyperbolic embeddings are a promising new research area that fits well into ICLR.	O	O	Review	705
Overall, the paper is written well and good to understand.	O	O	Review	705
It introduces interesting ideas that are promising to advance hyperbolic embeddings.	O	O	Review	705
However, in the current version of the paper, these ideas are not fully developed or their impact is unclear.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For instance, using Weierstrass coordinates as a representations seems to make sense, as it allows to use standard optimization methods without leaving the manifold.	B-Review	B-1	Review	705
However, it is important to note that the optimization is still performed on a Riemannian manifold.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
For that reason, following the Riemannian gradient along geodesics would still require the exponential map.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
Moreover, optimization methods like Adam or SVRG are still not directly applicable.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
Therefore, it seems that the practical benefit of this representation is limited.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Similarly, being able to compute the centroid efficiently in closed form is indeed an interesting aspect of the proposed approach.	B-Review	B-2	Review	705
Moreover, the paper explicitly connects the centroid to the least common ancestor of children in a[line_break_token]tree, what could be very useful to derive new embedding methods.	B-Review	B-3	Review	705
Unfortunately, this is advantage isn't really exploited in the paper.	I-Review	I-3	Review	705
The approach taken in the paper simply uses the loss function of Nickel & Kiela (2017) and this loss doesn't make use of centroids, as the paper notes itself.	O	O	Review	705
The only use of the centroid seems then to justify the regularization method, i.e., that parents should have a smaller norm than their children.	B-Review	B-3	Review	705
However, this insight alone seems not particularly novel, as the same insight can be derived for standard hyperbolic method and has, for instance, been discussed in Nickel & Kiela (2017, 2018), Ganea et al (2018), De Sa (2018).	O	O	Review	705
Using the centroid to derive new hyperbolic embeddings could be interesting, but, unfortunately, is currently not done in the paper.	B-Review	B-3	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Further comments[line_break_token]- p.3: Projection back onto the Poincar√© ball/manifold is only necessary when[line_break_token]  the exponential map isn't used.	B-Review	B-4	Review	705
The methods of Nickel & Kiela (2018), Ganea et al (2018) therefore don't have this problem.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token]- p.7: Since MR and MAP are ranking measures, and the ranking of distances between H^d and the L^2 distance should be identical, it is not clear to me why the experiments show significant differences for these methods when \beta=1[line_break_token]- p.7: Embeddings in the Poincar√© ball and the Hyperboloid are both compatible with the regularization method in eq.14 (using their respective norms).

It would be interesting to also see results for these methods with regularization.	B-Review	B-6	Review	705

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Theoretically, there are three theorems in section 3:[line_break_token][line_break_token]Theorem 3.1 shows the coordinate transformation from the proposed parametrization to hyperboloid then to Poincare ball preserves the monotonicity of the Euclidean norm.

This is straightforward by writing down the two transformations.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Lemma 3.2 and theorem 3.3 state the centroid in closed expression based on the Lorentzian distance, taking advantage that the  Lorentzian distance is in a bi-linear form (no need to take the arcosh()  therefore the analysis are much more simplified) These results are quite striaghtforward from the expression of the energy function.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Theorem 3.4  (centroid computation with constraints) shows that minimizing the energy function, when a is constrained to a discrete set, is equivalent to minimizing, where is given by Lemma 3.2.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token]This is interesting as compared to the previous two theorems, but it is not clear whether/how this equivalence is used in the proposed embedding.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Technically, there are three novel contributions,[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	705

The cost is based on the Lorentzian Distance, that is a monotonic transformation of the Riemannian distance (without taking the arccosh function).	O	O	Review	705

Summary:[line_break_token]The paper proposes a method for coordinating the exploration efforts of agents in a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting.	O	O	Review	705
The approach has two main components: (i) learning different exploration policies using different "joint" intrinsic rewards; and (ii) learning a higher-level policy that selects one of the exploration policies to be executed at the beginning of each episode.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Each agent has its own novelty function which quantifies the novelty of observation seen by that agent.	O	O	Review	705
To coordinate exploration, these novelty functions are combined using aggregation functions to produce intrinsic reward for the agent.	O	O	Review	705
Each such aggregating function yields a different intrinsic reward.	O	O	Review	705
The authors propose several such aggregating functions as examples, however the method is applicable to other aggregating functions as well, as long as they can be computed off-policy.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]During training, the higher level policy selects one of the exploration policies which is then executed for the entire episode.	O	O	Review	705
The episode data is used in two ways: (i) to train the higher-level policy using policy gradients for maximizing extrinsic rewards along with an entropy term; and (ii) to train each exploration policy using soft actor-critic on its own intrinsic reward function (and extrinsic reward) in an off-policy manner.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experiments done on grid-world and VizDoom environment for three different tasks demonstrate that, on most tasks, the proposed approach performs at least as well as separately trained individual intrinsic rewards.	O	O	Review	705
Further ablation studies confirm that both the hierarchical setup and the "joint" intrinsic rewards are useful.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Questions to the Authors:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	705
The second sentence in section 5 is not clear - "Furthermore, the type of reward ... sufficiently complex".	B-Review	B-1	Review	705
The high-level policy selects an exploration strategy at the beginning of each episode and then sticks to it for the entire duration of the episode.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
Changing the exploration strategy over the course of training might be useful in cases when agent needs to switch to a different exploration strategy after reaching a particular bottleneck state.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
However, this would require the exploration strategy to be changed in the middle of an episode which is not supported.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
Could you give an example where the exploration strategy must be changed over time even if one only selects the strategy at the beginning of each episode?	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
Also, why not select the exploration strategy after every fixed number of time steps within each episode (by making high-level policy a function of the current state)?	I-Review	I-1	Review	705

To address your first point, we can provide an illustrative example.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	705
Let us say that we are attempting to solve task 1, where agents must spread out and collect all rewards on the map.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
In this case it is possible that Leader-Follower rewards may be most successful at first since they all explore similar areas simultaneously, so if they happen to reach a region where a reward is located, there will be multiple agents there to have a chance at collecting it; however, this behavior is not optimal, as there are other rewards to collect around the map.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
At this point in training, burrowing rewards may become more optimal since at least one of the agents will continue exploring the same region to collect the reward, but the other agents will explore other regions, potentially collecting more rewards.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
We find that this type of situation occurs with reasonable frequency during training.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705

We show that naive applications of single-agent methods (Figure 3b independent and centralized intrinsic rewards) to multi-agent systems are relatively ineffective when compared to our approach.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	705

Overall I like the approach in the paper.	O	O	Review	705
It proposes a nice 2 pronged method for exploiting exploration via intrinsic rewards for multi-agent systems.	O	O	Review	705
The parts that a bit lacking with the current version of the paper in this are the evaluation tasks are few and a bit simple and I think there needs to be more discussion on the "coverage" of the intrinsic reward types.	B-Review	B-17	Review	705
Are the ones proposed motivated by the tasks in the paper or are they sufficient for tasks in general?	B-Review	B-15	Review	705
 Last using a more recent novelty metric could allow the method to work on more interesting/complex tasks.	B-Review	B-16	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]More detailed feedback:[line_break_token]- It would be good to include more learning curves in the main text for the paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	705
[line_break_token]- The fact that applying intrinsic motivation to multi-agent simulations seems like a natural idea would be to convert the problem to a "single" agent problem to compare against the "normal" application of intrinsic rewards.	B-Review	B-2	Review	705
This might be another baseline to consider for comparison.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
[line_break_token]- It says that all agents share the same replay buffer.	B-Review	B-3	Review	705
Does this also imply that every agent is performing the same task there are just many agents?	I-Review	I-3	Review	705
This does not make the problem very multi-agent with different goals.	I-Review	I-3	Review	705
Would it affect the algorithm significantly to work on an environment where the agents have various types of goals?	I-Review	I-3	Review	705
[line_break_token]- As is noted in the text, this method appears to work well in the centralized training scheme that many have adopted recently.	B-Review	B-10	Review	705
However, It makes me wonder if there is a way to employ these exploration schemes in a non-centralized training form.	I-Review	I-10	Review	705
The ability to ask other agents in the world about there preferences and novelty of states appears to be a strong assumption, especially in a multi-agent robotics problem.	I-Review	I-10	Review	705
[line_break_token]- While the authors note that the intrinsic rewards used in this work are not comprehensive it would be good to note how comprehensive they are.	B-Review	B-11	Review	705
Are there a few that were left out on purpose.	I-Review	I-11	Review	705
Do the authours believe this set is sufficient.	I-Review	I-11	Review	705
This statement makes it seem like the authors just tried a few options and found one that worked.	I-Review	I-11	Review	705
It would be good to expand on this discussion more.	I-Review	I-11	Review	705
[line_break_token]- More detail for Figure 1 would be helpful to understand the overall network design.	B-Review	B-12	Review	705
While that figure it helpful maybe it would be good to include a version that goes into detail for the 2 agent environment.	I-Review	I-12	Review	705
Then a more compressed n agent version can also be shown.	I-Review	I-12	Review	705
[line_break_token]- The paper describes a policy selector that is a type of high-level policy for HRL.	B-Review	B-13	Review	705
This design seems rather unique in that this part of the policy can optimizing for which intrinsic reward to toggle based on the extrinsic rewards observed.	I-Review	I-13	Review	705
I like it.	I-Review	I-13	Review	705
It is noted that entropy is important for this design.	I-Review	I-13	Review	705
Can this be analyzed in an empirical way?	I-Review	I-13	Review	705
Is this true for most environments/tasks?	I-Review	I-13	Review	705
[line_break_token]- Task 2 seems a bit contrived.	B-Review	B-14	Review	705
Is there another instance of this type of task elsewhere in another paper?	I-Review	I-14	Review	705
It would be better to use more standard tasks if they are available.	I-Review	I-14	Review	705
[line_break_token]- Before section 6.1 the paper is discussing rewards the are received.	B-Review	B-4	Review	705
It would be good to more explicit about where these rewards are coming from.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
I think it is meant that these rewards are the extrinsic rewards but it does not say.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
[line_break_token]- As noted just before section 6.1 it seems for the collection of tasks 1-3 it is already obvious what types of intrinsic rewards should be used.	B-Review	B-5	Review	705
It would be good to include more tasks where this decision is less obvious.	I-Review	I-5	Review	705
[line_break_token]- Why are there "black holes" in the environment?	B-Review	B-6	Review	705
Also if an agent steps into a black hole they are crushed never to be seen again.	I-Review	I-6	Review	705
What you describe sounds more like a wormhole where one end is non-stationary... Also, can the agents detect the presence of a black hole in some way?	I-Review	I-6	Review	705
[line_break_token]- It appears the novel metric is count based.	B-Review	B-7	Review	705
While this can work in practice it seems a rather simple metric.	I-Review	I-7	Review	705
Is it possible to use something more like ICM or RND that was referenced in the paper?	I-Review	I-7	Review	705
Especially for the VizDoom environment?	I-Review	I-7	Review	705
[line_break_token]- In table 2 where are some of the numbers bold?	B-Review	B-8	Review	705
It would be good to include this information in the caption for the table.	I-Review	I-8	Review	705
[line_break_token]- I am not sure if the discussion on the behaviours the intrinsic reward functions result in are very surprising.	B-Review	B-9	Review	705
Maybe there is a more interesting behaviour that results from the combination of two intrinsic rewards?	I-Review	I-9	Review	705
[line_break_token]	O	O	Review	705
hank you for the detailed and insightful comments.	O	O	Reply	705
 We would like first to articulate more clearly the motivation behind the tasks we have used.	B-Reply	B-15	Reply	705
When we consider the setting of multi-agent systems, we believe the notion of spatial coordination is of natural interest.	I-Reply	I-15	Reply	705
In other words, should agents in such environments coordinate their spatial positioning while exploring.	I-Reply	I-15	Reply	705
Our tasks are designed to test the extremes of the spectrum of spatial coordination (i.e. close together (task 2) vs. far apart (task 1)).	I-Reply	I-15	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]When designing intrinsic reward functions, we focus on inducing spatial coordination in a general manner that does not use domain-specific knowledge.	B-Reply	B-17	Reply	705
We argue that using these types of rewards for spatially coordinated exploration is generally useful for many problems in multi-agent systems.	I-Reply	I-17	Reply	705
 The key contribution of our work is to provide examples which introduce a framework for expressing intrinsic reward functions that induce spatially coordinated exploration.	I-Reply	I-17	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding the use of more recent novelty metrics: we *thoroughly* tested Random Network Distillation [2] on the ViZDoom tasks and concluded that RND is unsuitable for the domain.	B-Reply	B-16	Reply	705
It is especially sensitive to the brightness of the input images, causing heavily visited rooms in the map with brighter walls leading to higher intrinsic rewards than unvisited dark colored rooms.	I-Reply	I-16	Reply	705
Image preprocessing techniques (contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization) improved performance somewhat, but the exploration was still highly biased towards specific regions.	I-Reply	I-16	Reply	705
We also implemented and tested the Intrinsic Curiosity Module [3] though we have not been able to replicate the results from the original paper and thus, cannot comment on its efficacy within our framework at this time.	I-Reply	I-16	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Below we will answer specific questions that were not answered above:[line_break_token][line_break_token]-Comparing to single-agent intrinsic rewards[line_break_token][line_break_token]This is an interesting point, and we have run the appropriate experiments to test its efficacy.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	705
We implement an intrinsic reward that considers the joint position of all agents (i.e. the inverse count of all agents being in their combined positions).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
Our initial hypothesis is that our intrinsic reward functions provide additional inductive biases which encourage spatial coordination and should outperform this standard centralized intrinsic reward function.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
Figures and a description of the implementation of centralized rewards are provided in the Appendix.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
We find that across all tasks with 2 agents our approach learns more efficiently than this baseline, confirming our hypothesis.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-Agents sharing the same replay buffer[line_break_token][line_break_token]We apologize for the confusion.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	705
Agents have multiple policy heads for each type of intrinsic reward, and these heads share experiences; however, agents do not share experiences with each other.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-Is it possible to decentralize training?	O	O	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This is an interesting question.	B-Reply	B-10	Reply	705
One can imagine an adaptation of our method where agents leave ‚Äúmarkers‚Äù of how novel a region is to themselves such that other agents can detect these markers when they enter the region.	I-Reply	I-10	Reply	705
In this way, the assumption of communicating the novelty of observations across agents can be removed and our approach can be adapted to a decentralized training regime.	I-Reply	I-10	Reply	705
We leave this for future work.	I-Reply	I-10	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-Can the importance of entropy in the policy selector be analyzed empirically?	O	O	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We include experiments of our method run without the entropy bonus on the meta-policy across all tasks with 2 agents in the Appendix.	B-Reply	B-13	Reply	705
We find that its removal consistently hurts performance across all settings.	I-Reply	I-13	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-Clarifying rewards described before section 6.1[line_break_token][line_break_token]Yes, we are referring to the extrinsic rewards.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	705
The text has been modified to make this more clear.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-Clarifying ‚Äúblack holes‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]These exist in order to make the exploration problem more challenging.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	705
Agents are able to detect the probability of any black hole in their immediate vicinity opening at the next time step, and must learn to navigate around them (i.e. wait for the probability of opening to be low).	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-Bolded numbers[line_break_token][line_break_token]The bolded numbers are those where the best mean score falls within one standard deviation of their score distribution.	B-Reply	B-8	Reply	705

Contribution:[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper proposes to use a set of handcrafted intrinsic rewards that depend on the novelty of an observation as perceived by the rest of the other agents.	O	O	Review	705
For each pair of reward and agent, they learn a policy and a value through actor critic method, and then a meta-policy choses at the beginning of each episode which intrinsic rewards to use, meaning that the policy used by the agents corresponds to the one that maximizes the reward chosen.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Review:[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]The major limitation of the paper in my opinion is the fact that the "coordination" that occurs here is only happening at training time, not at execution time.	B-Review	B-1	Review	705
The agents eventually learn whatever trajectory they need to perform, and then proceed to do so without any interaction with the other agents.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
In a sense, they don't even learn to explore collaboratively.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
In other words, agents trained on task 1 in a given maze would not be able to solve task 2 on the same maze without essentially relearning everything from scratch.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
[line_break_token]The other corollary of the fact that each agent learns its own policy is that the number of agents is fixed at training time, preventing testing with a different number of agents, as sometimes done in the literature ([1] [2]).	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Given this limitation the scope of the work basically reduces to the exploration of a fixed environment when the action space can be factored into different agents.	B-Review	B-2	Review	705
This "multi-agent" formulation is presumably meant to break down the computational complexity of having a joint observation/action space.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
However, the experiments are conducted only with a very limited number of agents (only 2 in the non toy environment of vizdoom).	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
This small scale doesn't, in my opinion, demonstrate the advantage of the decomposition of the MDP over say SOTA single-agent exploration methods applied to the cartesian product of all the agents action spaces (in vizdoom the paper considers only 3 actions, so with two agents it would amount to 9 actions, which is still very tractable).	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
Once the trajectories of both agents are found, they can be distilled to each of them individually so that they only depend on the local observation.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding the experiments on the Vizdoom environment, it appears that the traditional evaluation setup [3] doesn't involve providing the global position (x,y) to the agents as part of the observations (they must be inferred from the visual feed), contrary to the experimental setup presented in this paper.	B-Review	B-3	Review	705
[line_break_token]In my opinion, this weakens the claim that the method "scales to more complex environments" since providing the position essentially makes the environment similar to a grid-world (arguably the visual feed isn't even needed to solve the task.	I-Review	I-3	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]The use of a dynamic policy selection is somewhat interesting, but would benefit better investigation.	B-Review	B-4	Review	705
Firstly, it is not clear to me if all the selection of the policy to use during training affects all the trajectories of the batch, or if different episodes of the batch may have a different policy.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
[line_break_token]Secondly, it seems that the setting is typically the one of a (non-stationary) bandit, since there is no state and the "reward" is the return obtained by the policy.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
Could you share the reason behind the choice of an actor-critic algorithm over classical bandit algorithms?	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
One obvious advantage of the latter are provable regret bounds.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
[line_break_token]In all, the selection policy seems to be useful during training, since it sometimes yields better solutions than any of the individual reward schemes.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
It suggests that some form of curriculum over the rewards is occurring during training, but if this is really what is going on, then it's possible that the relevant literature about curriculum learning may offer more stable and principled solutions than an actor critic, for example population based training.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
This could potentially solve the issues observed in task 2.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705

Concerning the point of coordination only happening at training time, this is in fact by design.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	705
We are operating within the recently popularized regime of centralized training with decentralized execution [1,2,3], while the works referenced by the reviewer are concerned with learning a centralized controller.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
Within this regime, communication between agents is assumed to not be possible at testing time, so agents must learn to operate independently and coordination must be incorporated somehow during training.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
Furthermore, we are not concerned with learning policies that transfer between tasks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
As is common in the intrinsic motivation literature, we simply want to explore the environment in order to enable learning in a single task with sparse rewards.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token][tab_token]The multi-agent formulation is not designed to break down the computational complexity of the problem, but rather our method is designed to be useful in multi-agent scenarios by incorporating inductive biases regarding spatial coordination.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	705
While the suggestion of learning with the joint action space and distilling to decentralized policies could potentially work for the 2 agent VizDoom case, such an approach would not work even in the 4 agent gridworld setting, where the joint action space contains 625 actions.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
An approach that would not work in this ‚Äútoy‚Äù environment is not particularly useful to the multi-agent RL community.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
Furthermore, we have run experiments where we maintain our centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm but use intrinsic rewards where the agents are treated as one agent (this was also asked for by R1).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
Concretely, we use the inverse count of all agents being at their current positions, rather than considering agents independently.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
We refer the reviewer to the curves labelled ‚ÄúCentralized‚Äù in Appendix section A.5.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
We find that, while this approach is somewhat effective, it does not learn as quickly as our approach since it does not induce agents to coordinate their regions of exploration.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token][tab_token]In VizDoom we do not provide the agents‚Äô locations as part of the observations.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	705
As described in the appendix, we provide the egocentric image view, along with an indicator of whether each reward has been collected.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	705
The global state, however, does include the agents‚Äô locations and orientations, but this information is only available to the critic and not available to the policies during execution.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token][tab_token]To clarify the use of the policy selector: it only affects the selection of policies to use during rollouts.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	705
During training, all policies are trained simultaneously using off-policy methods.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	705
The point regarding non-stationary bandits is an interesting one.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	705
In fact, it was our first instinct to use such methods for the policy selector; however, we found that the convergence guarantees rely on assumptions on the nature of how the reward distribution evolves.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	705
Since we cannot characterize the evolution of rewards received by each policy type very well, we resorted to the policy gradient method described, which we find works well empirically.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	705
We have provided additional analysis of the nature of the policy selector and how it enables our method to surpass the performance of individual intrinsic reward methods (Appendix section A.6).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	705
We have not considered the idea of applying curriculum learning methods to our approach, though it is interesting and worth exploring.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	705

This paper presents a computational model of motivation for Q learning and relates it to biological models of motivation.	O	O	Review	705
Motivation is presented to the agent as a component of its inputs, and is encoded in a vectorised reward function where each component of the reward is weighted.	O	O	Review	705
This approach is explored in three domains: a modified four-room domain where each room represents a different reward in the reward vector, a route planning problem, and a pavlovian conditioning example where neuronal activations are compared to mice undergoing a similar conditioning.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Review Summary:[line_break_token]I am uncertain of the neuroscientific contributions of this paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	705
From a machine learning perspective, this paper has insufficient details to assess both the experimental contributions and proposed formulation of motivation.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
It is unclear from the discussion of biological forms of motivation, and from the experimental elaboration of these ideas, that the proposed model of motivation is a novel contribution.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
For these reasons, I suggest a reject.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The Four Rooms Experiment:[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the four-rooms problem, the agent is provided with a one-hot encoding representing which cell it the agent is located in within the grid-world.	B-Review	B-2	Review	705
The reward given to the agent is a combination of the reward signal from the environment (a one-hot vector where the activation is dependent on the room occupied by the agent) and the motivation vector, which is a weighting of the rooms.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
One agent is given access to the weighting vector mu in its state vector: the motivation is concatenated to the position, encoding the weighting of the rooms at any given time-step.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
The non-motivated agent does not have access to mu in its state, although its reward is weighted as the motivated agent‚Äôs is.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
The issue with this example is that the non-motivated agent does not have access to the information required to learn a value-function suitable to solve this problem.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
By not giving the motivation vector to non-motivated agent, the problem has become a partially observable problem, and the comparison is now between a partially observable and fully observable setting, rather than a commentary on the difference between learning with and without motivation.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In places, the claims made go beyond the results presented.	B-Review	B-3	Review	705
How do we know that the non-motivated network is engaging in a "non-motivated delay binge"?	I-Review	I-3	Review	705
We certainly can see that the agent acquires an average reward of 1, but it is not evident from this detail alone that the agent is engaging in the behaviour that the paper claims.	I-Review	I-3	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Moreover, the network was trained 41 times for different values of the motivation parameter theta.	B-Review	B-4	Review	705
Counting out the points in figure 2, it would suggest that the sweep was over 41 values of theta, which leaves me wondering if the results represent a single independent trial, or whether the results are averaged over multiple trials.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
Looking at the top-right hand corner I see a single yellow dot (non-motivated agent) presented in line with blue (motivated agent) suggesting that the point is possibly an outlier.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
Given this outlier, I‚Äôm led believe that the graph represents a single independent trial.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
A single trial is insufficient to draw conclusions about the behaviour of an agent.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The Path Routing Experiment:[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the second experiment, where a population of agents is presented in fig 5, it is claimed that on 82% of the trials, the agent was able to find the shortest path.	B-Review	B-5	Review	705
Looking at the figure itself, at the final depicted iteration, all of the points are presented in a different colour and labelled ‚Äúshortest path‚Äù.	I-Review	I-5	Review	705
The graph suggests that 100% of the agents found the shortest path.	I-Review	I-5	Review	705
The claim is made that for the remaining 18% of the agents, the agents found close to the shortest path‚Äîa point not evident in the figures presented.	I-Review	I-5	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Pavlovian Conditioning Experiment:[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the third experiment, shouldn‚Äôt Q(s) be V(s)?	B-Review	B-6	Review	705
In this setting, the agent is not learning the value of a state action pair, but rather the value of a state.	I-Review	I-6	Review	705
Moreover, the value is described as Q(t), where t is the time-step in the trial; however, elsewhere in the text it is mentioned that the state is not simply t, but contains also the motivation value mu.	I-Review	I-6	Review	705
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]The third experiment does not have enough detail to interpret the results.	B-Review	B-7	Review	705
It is unclear how many trials there were for both of the prediction settings.	I-Review	I-7	Review	705
It is unclear whether the problem described is a continuing problem or a terminating prediction problem‚Äîi.e.,	I-Review	I-7	Review	705
whether after the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus are presented to the agent, does the time-step (and thus the state) reset to 0, or does time continue incrementing?	I-Review	I-7	Review	705
If it is a terminating prediction problem, it is unclear whether the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus were delivered on the same time-steps for each independent trial.	I-Review	I-7	Review	705
If I am interpreting the state-construction correctly, the state is incrementing by one on each time-step; this problem is effectively a Markov Reward Process where the agent transitions from one state to the next until time stops with no ability to transition to previous states.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The neuroscientific contribution of the paper, briefly speaking, is the following.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
In behavioral experiments, mice are often kept water-deprived, so that the reward upon task completion is lucrative.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
This approach relies on the assumption that the perceived value of a reward depends not only on its physical value, but also on external factors.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
Although the existence of such dependence ‚Äì named the motivational salience ‚Äì is known in psychology and has been modelled in neuroscience, it is still unclear how motivation affects the reward perception in the brain.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
To this end, the results of numerous behavioral experiments critically rely on the process that is not yet well understood.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To bridge this gap, we propose a functional circuit in the brain that may modulate the reward perception using motivation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
Specifically, we found two large groups of cells in the ventral pallidum: cells tuned to positive and negative motivation respectively.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
We built an RL model suggesting that these two groups of cells may be connected through a recurrent ‚Äúpush-pull‚Äù circuit (Fig.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
7F), retaining the information about the upcoming reward based on the cue and motivation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
Overall, our work yields important insights into the reward processing in the brain, and motivates future studies in the reward circuitry, thus contributing to rigorous interpretation of behavioral data.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The Four Rooms Experiment:[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚ÄúThe issue with this example is that the non-motivated agent does not have access to the information required to learn a value-function suitable to solve this problem.	O	O	Reply	705
By not giving the motivation vector to non-motivated agent, the problem has become a partially observable problem, and the comparison is now between a partially observable and fully observable setting, rather than a commentary on the difference between learning with and without motivation.	O	O	Reply	705
‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors argue that in the Four Rooms experiment, the latent variable (motivation) has deterministic dynamics; therefore, an agent can learn to predict the exact reward on every iteration based on location, making the latent variable (motivation) unnecessary for the state formulation.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	705
In this regard, the environment is fully observable.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
Moreover, an agent is capable of learning such reward dynamics ‚Äì as shown by the non-motivated outlier agent in the Fig.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
2B. Yet, the rest of non-motivated agents were far less successful in maximizing the reward, as compared to the motivated agents under the same learning parameters.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Using the arguments above, the authors prefer to attribute the boost in learning to motivation.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
However, we would like to acknowledge that, to the letter of POMDP definition (having a latent variable hidden from the agent), the Reviewer #3 is right in classifying the non-motivated setting as POMDP.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
To this end, we also would not mind saying that motivation converts POMDP to MDP to facilitate learning the optimal policies.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705

How do we know that the non-motivated network is engaging in a "non-motivated delay binge"?‚Äú[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors thank the Reviewer #3 for this catch.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	705
We should have stated explicitly that for each run, we displayed sequences of agent's locations to establish correspondence between policies and average reward rates.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	705
We included this statement in the newly written Methods appendix	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	705

The authors investigate mechanisms underlying action selection in artificial agents and mice.	O	O	Review	705
To achieve this goal, they use RL to train neural networks to choose actions that maximize their temporally discounted sum of future rewards.	O	O	Review	705
Importantly, these rewards depend on a motivation factor that is itself a function of time and action; this motivation factor is the key difference between the authors' approach and "vanilla" RL.	O	O	Review	705
In simple tasks, the RL agent learns effective strategies (i.e., migrating between rooms in Fig.	O	O	Review	705
1, and minimizing path lengths for the vehicle routing problem in Fig.	O	O	Review	705
5).	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors then apply their model to a task in which the agent is presented with sound cues.	O	O	Review	705
Depending on the trial block, the reward for the given cue is either zero, positive, or negative; the authors suggest that these varying reward values correspond to varying motivational states.	O	O	Review	705
In this setting, the model learns to have two populations of units; each selective to either positive or negative rewards.	O	O	Review	705
Recurrent excitation within populations and mutual inhibition between populations define the learned dynamics.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally, the authors train mice on this same task, and record from neurons in area VP.	O	O	Review	705
Those neurons show a similar structure to the RNN: subpopulations of neurons respond to either positive or negative rewards.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, I'd like to thank the authors for the excellent clarity of this paper.	O	O	Review	705
It was very clear, and interesting to read.	O	O	Review	705
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]I have some suggestions for how to deepen the connection between the model and the experiment, and some concerns about the necessity of the motivation framework to the Pavlovian task:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) The authors make the prediction that neurons in VP should show (functional) connectivity matching that learned by their model.	B-Review	B-1	Review	705
This could be tested in their data.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
If that prediction is true, then one should see positive noise correlations for neuron pairs of the same preference (i.e., within the same pool, defined by spiking more for positive, or for negative rewards), and negative noise correlations for pairs of neurons with different preferences (i.e., one neuron in each pool).	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) A recent preprint by Sederberg and Nemenman (doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/779223)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://doi.org/10.1101/779223)</a> argued against over-interpreting the stimulus selectivity of neurons in recurrent circuits.	O	O	Review	705
They showed that, even in randomly connected (untrained) networks: a) neurons show either positive or negative selectivity; and b) neuron pairs with selectivity for the same stimulus (or task) feature tend to excite each other, and neuron pairs with opposite selectivity tend to inhibit each other.	B-Review	B-2	Review	705
 Given that finding, I wonder how compelling is the match between the mouse data and the RL agent (Figs.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
6 and 7): could randomly-connected untrained networks show similar phenomena as in the mouse (Fig.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
6)?	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I'm not asking if the untrained network can duplicate all the details of the trained one in Fig.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
7.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
Just whether the mouse data could be recapitulated by a simpler (no training) model.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) For the Pavlovian conditioning in the RL agent, I'm not sure I'd describe this as changing motivation.	B-Review	B-3	Review	705
It seems instead that the (external) reward contingency really changes between states.	I-Review	I-3	Review	705
So the fact that the same network can make predictions in both cases seems more like metalearning than motivation-based action selection.	I-Review	I-3	Review	705
For this reason, it's hard for me to connect the two halves of the paper: the first half has nice ideas on motivation-based action selection, while the second one has no apparent action selection, and hence no mechanism for the agent's motivation to matter.	I-Review	I-3	Review	705

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors agree with the rationale for the proposed analysis.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	705
Unfortunately, the full data containing the individual spikes is not yet available for analysis due to handling delays; instead, we operated on the average activations for each cell (Fig.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
6C, D, F).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
To this end, in our original submission we did a simpler version of what the Reviewer #2 proposed ‚Äì though we did not expand its description due to the space limitations.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
Namely, we averaged activity of each cell under each experimental condition, and then used correlations of the average activities to cluster cells in the data.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
This way, activities of the cells within a same cluster had positive correlation, as anticipated by the Reviewer #2; the property of being positive/negative with respect to reward was established through visually evaluating cell activations in each cluster (Fig.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
6C, D, F).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
[line_break_token]To include an explicit description of correlation-based clustering procedure in the paper, we included the following statement in the newly written Methods appendix: ‚ÄúWe then clustered the recurrent neurons after training as follows.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
First, for every neuron we computed 6 average activations, corresponding to the unique types of trials (positive/negative motivation with zero/small/large reward).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
Then, we used the average activations to compute a correlation matrix for the neurons.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705

[line_break_token][line_break_token]We appreciate the Reviewer #2 pointing out the paper by Sederberg and Nemenman, highlighting the issue of interpreting stimulus selectivity in recurrent circuits.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	705
Although we could not account for this work in our original submission ‚Äì as it was published two days before the conference deadline ‚Äì the authors agree that it is now reasonable to perform additional analysis, as suggested by the Reviewer #2.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
[line_break_token]In agreement with the conclusions of the paper, when we substitute the trained weights in the model with the random weights, we observe positive- and negative-selectivity cells.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
In particular, every cell has two tunings ‚Äì to motivation, and to cue (same as reward) ‚Äì reflecting two separate inputs to the neural network.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
In random (no training) models, these inputs are propagated through independent random weights of both signs.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
As a result ‚Äì and we observe it in simulation ‚Äì selectivity to motivation and selectivity to reward are independent, e.g. positive-motivation cell may be at the same time negatively tuned to the reward.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
Therefore, in total, random connectivity in our task yields four clusters of cells: (positively/negatively tuned to motivation/reward).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
On contrast, in the data, we only observe two clusters: positive-motivation cells are always positively tuned to reward, and negative-motivation cells are always negatively tuned to reward.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
Thus, a non-trained model does not recapitulate the mouse data.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705

This paper builds a model of motivation-dependent learning.	O	O	Review	705
 A motivation channel is provided as an additional input to and RL-based learning system (essentially concatenated to state information), similar to goal-conditioned approaches (as the authors mention).	O	O	Review	705
 The motivational variables evolve according to their own rules, and are designed/interpreted as biological motivations such as water, food, sleep and work.	O	O	Review	705
 While the narrative is interesting, I lean towards reject as I believe it failed to deliver on what it promised.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the first experiment, the satisfaction of these motivations are mapped onto a 4-room setting, where being in each room satisfies a motivation.	O	O	Review	705
 The choice to map the four rooms to biological drives is cute, but possibly confusing/misleading since this navigation problem really has nothing to do with these biological drives.	O	O	Review	705
A claim is that by providing the motivation as input to the policy, it is more robustly (across seeds) able to learn the "migration" (i.e. cycling) behavior among the rooms.	O	O	Review	705
 In a second example, a similar problem is solved involving navigation on a graph.	O	O	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The final, most substantial example, is a policy trained to solve a simple, abstract version of a behavioral task.	B-Review	B-2	Review	705
In this setting, a motivation channel was again used.	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
 However, the motivation channel value is now fixed to one of two discrete values, essentially meaning it is simply a task-label variable, a paradigm that has already been applied in the context of simple models of neuroscience tasks, e.g. see Song et al 2017 "Reward-based training of recurrent neural networks for cognitive and value-based tasks".	I-Review	I-2	Review	705
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]There is a bit of a mixed framing overall as to whether it is being claimed that the "motivation" being passed as an input is a fundamental contribution to AI/RL (I think it is not), versus the computational modeling of biological motivation.	B-Review	B-4	Review	705
 I think the people qualified to judge whether the computational model is a worthwhile model of motivation specifically are probably a narrower set of computational neuroscientists.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
 I do think there is value in the kind of computational modeling performed, involving establishing a relationship between training a neural network to solve a behavioral task and comparing this with real neural data.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
 This paradigm already becoming increasingly popular within computational neuroscience.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
 However, while I find the results slightly interesting, but not very significant, as someone interested in the biology of motivation, I question whether the nature of these contributions would be of broad interest at this venue.	I-Review	I-4	Review	705
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]More fundamentally, I don't believe there is a meaningful ML/AI/RL contribution, and I have some issues with the presentation of the first two examples.	B-Review	B-5	Review	705
 While I do like the narrative inspiring these problems, I find the implementations of the problems too simplified to really be meaningfully related to their inspiration (in terms of motivated behaviors).	I-Review	I-5	Review	705
 Rather than really model motivation as part of the policy architecture, the authors have proposed a solution to modeling motivation that makes motivation a feature of the environment.	I-Review	I-5	Review	705
 Essentially, the reward provided by the environment depends on an extra latent variable and by hiding this (in the cases where the policy does not see motivation inputs), it is quite likely that it becomes too difficult for the value function to predict what is happening (the environment has become partially observed).	I-Review	I-5	Review	705
 This seems less a setting where motivation channels solve a problem, and more just an example of an environment that has more complex rules for generating rewards being more challenging to learn about, especially if latent variables are not available to the value function.	I-Review	I-5	Review	705
 Critically, it has not been shown that motivational systems are useful for artificial agents, rather the tasks themselves have been designed to attempt to be models of biological motivation.	I-Review	I-5	Review	705
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]Personally, I am interested in motivated behaviors and think that future AI developments should take note of this field, but again, the present work does not provide actionable insights into implementing an artificial motivation system.	B-Review	B-1	Review	705
 At the same time, this work does not provide interesting enough neurobiological results for those to stand on their own either.	I-Review	I-1	Review	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor clarification:[line_break_token][line_break_token]"trained to perform in realistic tasks" -- the task is very simple.	B-Review	B-3	Review	705

One of such developments in the hierarchical RL (HRL) that has not been mapped on neural circuits yet.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
Our paper proposes that motivational salience, which we call ‚Äòmotivation‚Äô for brevity, may have evolved from modulating simple feeding behaviors to solving more complex hierarchical cognitive tasks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
As such, our paper aims at bridging the gap between HRL community in ML and neuro communities interested in understanding motivated behaviors.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
Clearly, building a motivated HRL model is not a task for a single paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
Our goal was therefore to introduce the concept of motivational salience to the ML community.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	705
In addition, we believe, we have made substantial contributions to computational neuroscience and to understanding of computational algorithms run by circuits in ventral pallidum (VP) as detailed below[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) Our paper presents the first example of neural network processing information about motivational salience.

Motivational salience has been described in RL framing before, but the networks processing motivation are missing.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	705
The reviewer may not agree with how we frame the problem, but, perhaps, it is also important to formulate one solution in order to compel community to find alternatives.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	705

[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) We explain the presence of two oppositely-tuned populations of neurons in VP as resulting from the need to solve temporal credit assignment problem via maintaining working memory about reward expectation between CS and US.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) Our general framework allows to derive clear experimentally testable predictions about network structure in VP.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	705
We use a conventional machine learning algorithm (recurrent network training using backpropagation) to derive the structure of the network in VP from the first principles and show that it should contain inhibitory connections between two populations of neurons.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
We agree with the reviewer that backpropagation has been used to train recurrent RL V-networks before, for example, in the neuroscience setting by Song et al (2017).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
However, Song et al (2017) did not show that the network has a push-pull architecture.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
Since this particular architecture is known to be important in neural systems, it is valuable to show that the same connectivity can be used in circuits implementing motivated behavior.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
We argue that the presence of the push-pull circuit leads to the emergence of the two oppositely tuned populations of neurons.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	705
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall we suggest that our paper introduces motivational salience as a potential basis of HRL, uses the general machine learning framework based on motivational salience to explain existing experimental data (two populations of neurons), and generates clear experimentally testable predictions about the structure of network of real biological neurons in basal ganglia.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]GMUs are related to "mixture of experts" in that different examples will be classified by different parts of the model, (but rather than routing/gating entire examples, individual hidden units are gated separately).	O	O	Review	360

Summary:[line_break_token]Standard CNN models for MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet are vulnerable with regard[line_break_token]to (adversarial) rotation and translation of images.	O	O	Review	719

To the best of our knowledge, none of the publicly available implementations for training state-of-the-art ImageNet or CIFAR10 models use random rotations as data augmentation.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	719
This is likely due to the fact that random rotations typically do not yield  any benefits in (non-robust) test error (as our experimental results show).	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We would also like to emphasize that all of our models were trained until convergence (the loss plateaued) and hence the reduced test performance is not an artifact of training for insufficient steps (we will add a note about this to our manuscript).	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	719
At a high level, a decrease in test performance due to data augmentation is not surprising.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	719
If the transformations used are not present in the test set, then a model that has learned to be invariant to these transformations will typically perform worse on the test set. (	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	719
This is also the case when learning models that are adversarially robust to L_p perturbations; there is a decrease in test accuracy.)	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	719
As an extreme, consider an MNIST model that learns to be invariant to rotations up to 180 degrees.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	719
Clearly, this invariance is only hurting the model's performance since it cannot easily distinguish '6' from '9'.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	719

Summary[line_break_token]The authors study robustness of neural networks for image recognition tasks with respect to geometric transformations in input space.	O	O	Review	719
The question is posed in an adversarial setting, where the authors exploit that Conv/ResNets are not fully translation and rotation invariant.	O	O	Review	719
The authors propose three untargeted attacks to increase the classification error of the network: a first-order method, an attack involving random transformations and a grid search of allowed transformations.	O	O	Review	719
For the random and grid search the worst prediction is considered the outcome of the attack.	O	O	Review	719
The authors observe that first-order attacks are not very successful in fooling the network compared to the grid search.	O	O	Review	719
Data augmentation as a counter measure is found to be not sufficient and adversarial (robust) training with respect to the random search attack is proposed in addition.	O	O	Review	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Evaluation[line_break_token]The paper is well written and particularly the empirical part is interesting.	O	O	Review	719
However, novelty is limited, the best approach boils down to a grid search that tests multiple hypotheses instead of a single one.	O	O	Review	719
There are some conceptual problems and important aspects like confidences of the classification are not addressed.	O	O	Review	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Novelty:[line_break_token]Many claims and observations appear trivial and well-known.	B-Review	B-1	Review	719
E.g.,[line_break_token]- the research question has already been addressed by related work, leaving the proposed attacks trivial given that the attack space (allowed transformations) is specified ad hoc and without a proper measure.	I-Review	I-1	Review	719
[line_break_token]- that data augmentation and training with the adversarial loss function (i.e. with the attack scheme in mind) is helpful is straight forward and not surprising[line_break_token][line_break_token]Detailed comments:[line_break_token]The authors study whether neural networks are robust to transformations in input space and resort to a benign adversarial setting.	I-Review	I-1	Review	719
I'm wondering whether this allows for an answer regarding general robustness?	B-Review	B-2	Review	719
That is, the experiments are conducted wrt the worst case, while the training does not account for an attack setting.	I-Review	I-2	Review	719
E.g, it is unclear why the classifier would not involve a pre-processing step to counter transformations in input space, see Rowley et al (1998).	I-Review	I-2	Review	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Translation and rotation invariance of neural networks has been addressed by many authors, e.g., see Jaderberg et al (2015) and Marcos et al (2017).	B-Review	B-3	Review	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Adversarial examples are defined to be similar and misclassified with high confidence.	B-Review	B-4	Review	719
[line_break_token]The similarity of the transformation is not addressed properly.	I-Review	I-4	Review	719
E.g., if the goal of the adversary is to force errors, why not allow for rotations of 180 degrees?	I-Review	I-4	Review	719
Pixel-based attacks (Goodfellow et al 2014) are more rigorous in this regard while the cited transformation-based attacks (Kanbak et al 2017; Xiao et al 2018) are virtually indistinguishable from the real test cases.	I-Review	I-4	Review	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The effectiveness of the grid search attack seems to be connected to performing individual tests for each test case where only the worst outcome would count.	B-Review	B-5	Review	719
The sheer number should render a misclassification more likely compared to the competitors.	I-Review	I-5	Review	719
This is supported by empirical findings showing that only a small subset of transformations per test case accounts for the misclassification on CIFAR10 and ImageNet (Fig.	I-Review	I-5	Review	719
10 in the Appendix).	I-Review	I-5	Review	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding the padding experiments, I wonder whether the network architecture is appropriate for the new input.	B-Review	B-6	Review	719

We thank the reviewer for their comments.	O	O	Reply	719
We will address concerns raised below:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- On the novelty of our approach.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	719
We are aware that the robustness of NNs to spatial transformations has already been addressed as a research question.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
We cite some of the relevant work (collecting all the citations in a vast field such as deep learning is unfortunately hardly possible) and we plan to add the references pointed out by the reviewer.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
However, we believe that our paper contains a number of novel contributions that are not present in prior work (as we outline in our "summary of contributions" section):[line_break_token]a) We evaluate concrete and natural baselines for improving spatial robustness.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
While our worst-of-10 training approach is inspired by robust optimization, it has not been applied in this form before (to the best of our knowledge).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
[line_break_token]b) We evaluate the robustness of L_inf trained models, as well as combinations of L_inf and spatial attacks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
[line_break_token]c) We provide insights on the performance of first-order methods for this task.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
[line_break_token]d) Finally, we point out that a few black-box queries suffice to find misclassifications.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
[line_break_token](Please also refer to our response to Reviewer 2 on the same topic.)	O	O	Reply	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The reviewer mentions multiple times how our results are trivial and not surprising.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	719
We believe that when a problem is as fundamental as the one we study, rigorous evaluation of simple baselines is an important contribution.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
We were not able to find such a thorough study in prior work.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- We are aware of the existence of rotation-invariant architectures as well as preprocessing approaches to transformation robustness.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	719
Our goal is to understand the spatial robustness of the most popular architectures used for these tasks and challenge the conventional wisdom that these architectures will automatically generalize to naturally occuring transformations.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	719
Regarding the results of Rowley et al (1998), we would like to emphasize that rotation-invariant face detection is significantly easier, since faces have a canonical orientations (whereas most CIFAR10 and ImageNet categories do not).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	719
The goal of Marcos et al (2017) is to learn models that are *fully* rotation invariant (i.e. 180 degree rotations are acceptable).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	719
This is a fundamentally different task from learning models robust to *small* rotations since the later can still exploit the orientation of the image to some extent.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	719
We will add a discussion of these papers in our manuscript.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The definition of adversarial examples we are concerned with is "images with semantically similar content that are classified differently".	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	719
Arguably, a 30 degree rotation does not change the content of the image to a human (see provided images in the Appendix), so we consider these to be valid adversarial examples.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
In contrast, a 180 degree rotation would certainly appear wrong or unnatural to a human, such as a '6' turned into a '9' or an upside-down boat.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
We don't view the "high confidence" component of "standard" adversarial examples as very important.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
After all, classifiers are evaluated based on their top1 (and sometimes top5) accuracy.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
Thus the relevant quantity in our setting is the robust accuracy.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
Similarly, we do not view indistinguishability as important, as long as the original and perturbed images have the same content to a human and do not appear clearly transformed.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- On related work: We want to emphasize that the attack of Xiao et al (2018) is a complex attack, operating in a much larger perturbation space (the space of smooth deformations) and utilizing *full gradient access* to the target model.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
It is natural to expect such an attack to succeed with high confidence with minimal distortion.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
At the same time, however, these cannot be seen as "naturally occuring transformations" outside of a security context, in contrast to rotations and translations.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We do not follow the reviewers‚Äô comments about the transformations of Kanbak et al (2018).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
The set of transformations from their paper is very similar to ours, differing in only in parametrization.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
We also want to emphasize that their paper focuses exclusively on first order methods.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
Thus the reliability of their evaluation (compared to the ground-truth gridding that we perform) is questionable given our results about the effectiveness of first-order methods.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
We already include a discussion about this paper in our manuscript.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- We do not understand the reviewer's concern about the amount of grid points used and would be grateful if the reviewer could further elaborate this point.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	719
If the loss landscape was as well-behaved as in the case of L_inf perturbations, an attack based on projected gradient descent would clearly match a grid search.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	719
After all, PGD is allowed full access to the gradient of the model (3 real numbers) whereas our grid attack only has access to the output label of the model (a single bit, "classified correctly" or "misclassified").	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	719

The paper tackles the collaborative multi-agent RL problem as the problem of finding almost-decentralized value functions, where the loss tries to minimize communications between the agents.	O	O	Review	719
The core idea is around maximizing the mutual information between each massage and the existing knowledge of its receiver.	O	O	Review	719
This way, redundant messages are naturally removed.	O	O	Review	719
The authors then assert an entropy regularization to (almost) prevent the agents from *cheating*. The paper is in general well-written and motivated.	O	O	Review	719
There are however certain issues that should be addressed. [	O	O	Review	719
The second one is my main issue.]	O	O	Review	719
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	719
The term *message* has been used repeatedly but not defined.	B-Review	B-1	Review	719
You should define precisely what you mean by a message in the background section.	I-Review	I-1	Review	719
In particular, it is not clear from the text what a message looks like mathematically.	I-Review	I-1	Review	719
You may also consider giving intuitive examples of how different ways of designing a message alters the behaviour in a given context before start talking about how to optimise them.	I-Review	I-1	Review	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	719
Section 3.1 needs a revisit.	B-Review	B-2	Review	719
I assume by "optimal action policy of agent j" you mean "optimal policy of agent j".	I-Review	I-2	Review	719
Formally, an optimal policy is greedy to the optimal value function and is deterministic unless there exist multiple actions with same optimal value at a given state.	I-Review	I-2	Review	719
Therefore, the mutual information is not mathematically well-defined since most of the time the optimal policy is deterministic and does not induce a probability distribution.	I-Review	I-2	Review	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.1 What is the optimal value function of an agent?	I-Review	I-2	Review	719
The agents are not optimizing their own value function, so even if your complex model converges, it does not imply optimality of agent-level value functions (and they shouldn‚Äôt be locally optimal).	I-Review	I-2	Review	719
If by that you mean the agent-level value functions *after* convergence of, then you need to clarify it to avoid the confusion.	I-Review	I-2	Review	719
Even so, it is still not clear how you conceive the agent-level policies from these value functions.	I-Review	I-2	Review	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.2.	O	O	Review	719
Minor: As for the notation, I found quite strange for a policy; you may want to consider something like.	B-Review	B-2	Review	719
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	I-Review	I-2	Review	719
If is learnt, then message encoding is not stationary at least in the training time.	B-Review	B-3	Review	719
It may make the training potentially become unstable.	I-Review	I-3	Review	719
Specifically, there is no condition to assure stability of your model.	I-Review	I-3	Review	719
Suggestion: your entropy regularization might be sufficient to induce stability.	I-Review	I-3	Review	719
More discussion on this (or a simple experiment to show if an instability exists and will be alleviated with regularization) would be quite helpful.	I-Review	I-3	Review	719
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]4.	O	O	Review	719
If I understand it correctly [and it wasn't clear from the text], the encoder is conditioned on local history, which induces that all the agents must share same history shape (tensor-wise), which in turn means that all the local agents has to have same local state shape (computationally, they should for example have same output/internal-state shape in their neural networks).	B-Review	B-4	Review	719
This sounds like a limitation, and it may only be OK in domains where agents are homogenous.	I-Review	I-4	Review	719
[line_break_token]	O	O	Review	719
hanks for your detailed and constructive comments.	O	O	Reply	719
Here we provide explanations to clarify your questions.	O	O	Reply	719
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]Q1: Precise definition of the message.	O	O	Reply	719
[line_break_token]A1: A message from agent to agent encodes necessary information of the local observation-action history of agent, which is helpful for the decision making of agent.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	719
Precisely, a message is defined as a sample drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, whose covariance is a unit matrix and whose mean is given by an encoder, where is the local observation-action history of agent and are parameters of the encoder.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
As the reviewer suggested, we have refined and moved this definition to the beginning of Sec.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
3 in the updated version of our paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]Q2: Confusion about "optimal action policy of agent" in Sec 3.1.	O	O	Reply	719
[line_break_token]A2: Sorry, this is a typo.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	719
It should be ‚Äúaction selection of agent‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	719
 As shown in Fig.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	719
1, the mutual information is defined between messages and action selection.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	719
The variable used in the definition of mutual information is a random variable, whose probability distribution describes how the actions are selected by agent.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	719
As action selection may depend on other agents, action selection can be stochastic and thus the mutual information is still well-defined.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	719
We have added more descriptions in the updated version of our paper.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	719
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]Q3: Stability issue of our model.	O	O	Reply	719
[line_break_token]A3: Like QMIX, during the training, our model is just one neural network (the message encoder can be regarded as some hidden layers), which is trained in an end-to-end fashion.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	719
Therefore, the message encoder will not introduce extra instability, and our model is faced with similar stability issue with QMIX.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	719
As in QMIX (and many other works in deep reinforcement learning), we use target networks, for both value functions and the message encoder, to stabilize training.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	719
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]Q4: The same history shape of agents limits the domains that our method can be applied.	O	O	Reply	719
[line_break_token]A4: Like most algorithms in MARL, we share network structure and parameters among agents.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	719
Such sharing is feasible because in common MARL benchmarking environments, such as SC2 unit micromanagement [Samvelyan et al AAMAS 2019] and MPE [Lowe et al NeurIPS 2017], heterogeneous agents have observation and action spaces with the same shape.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719
In our SC2 experiments, results on three tasks (1o2r_vs_4r, 1o10b_vs_1r, and MMM) verify that our approach works well with heterogeneous agents.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	719

[line_break_token] [line_break_token]Recently, the learning paradigm of value function factorization stands out as an effective approach for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. [	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	719
Samvelyan et al AAMAS 2019] shows that its performance is much better than multi-agent policy gradients and independent value-based algorithm on StarCraft II micromanagement tasks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]However, current value function factorization methods *fully* decompose the Q-functions among agents, and, as a result, each agent acts solely on its own local observations during execution.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
This full decomposition is not effective in many cases, because it is quite common that an agent‚Äôs optimal decision makings sometimes depend on information from other agents.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]To address these limitations, in this paper, we develop a novel function factorization method that learns nearly decomposable value functions.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
Our model learns not only Q-functions for agents but also communication protocols for their improved coordination.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
Different from other communication approaches, we explicitly formalize novel optimization objectives for minimizing communication so that only useful and necessary information (those can reduce uncertainty in value functions of other agents) can be exchanged between agents.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719
These novelties explain why our method can significantly improve the performance of QMIX on StarCraft II micromanagement tasks even when 80% of the messages are cut off while other communication methods, e.g., TarMAC [Das et al ICML 2019], can not.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	719

The main contribution of this paper is to propose an improvement to the bits back (BB) coding scheme by using asymmetric numeral systems (ANS) rather than arithmetic coding for the implementation.	O	O	Review	578
ANS is a natural fit with BB since it traverses the coded sequence stack-style rather than FIFO.	O	O	Review	578
A second contribution is show how generative models with continuous latent variables can be used (via discretization) within this scheme.	O	O	Review	578
The paper is generally well-written, and the explanation in Sec 2.4 was especially clear.	O	O	Review	578
However I have some questions about the evaluation and practical application of this scheme.	O	O	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The comparison in Figure 1 is very compelling, but it would be helpful to have some additional information.	B-Review	B-1	Review	578
In particular, does the size reported for BB-ANS include any overhead related to meta information (e.g., number of images stored, their dimensions, format, etc.)?	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
PNG is a general purpose image file format, so it certainly contains such overhead.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
This makes it unclear how fair of a comparison we have here.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
Similarly, bz2 is a general purpose file compression scheme.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
What file format were the images written as before being compressed?	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
Either of those cases (PNG, bz2) could be opened on any other computer without the need for additional information (just a program that knows how to read/decompress those file formats).	B-Review	B-2	Review	578
On the other hand, the BB-ANS bitstream is not interpretable without the models used when compressing, and as discussed in Sec 4.3, there is certainly additional overhead involved in communicating the model which is not indicated here.	I-Review	I-2	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In any case, the compression rate achieved is impressive, but at the same time, not so surprising given that the model was trained on MNIST.	B-Review	B-3	Review	578
Have you checked how well a model trained on a more general image dataset (e.g., ImageNet) compresses other images (e.g., MNIST)?	I-Review	I-3	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Sec 3.2 mentions finding that around 400 clean bits are required.	B-Review	B-4	Review	578
How does the performance vary as fewer (or more) clean bits are used?	I-Review	I-4	Review	578
More generally, do you have suggestions for how to determine an appropriate number of clean bits for other scenarios? (	I-Review	I-4	Review	578
E.g., does it depend on the number of images to be compressed?	I-Review	I-4	Review	578
their size?	I-Review	I-4	Review	578
some notion of the entropy of the set of images to be compressed?	I-Review	I-4	Review	578
other factors?)	I-Review	I-4	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Also, how does the performance vary with the number of symbols (images) to be compressed?	B-Review	B-5	Review	578
I'd believe that the compression rate approaches the ELBO as the number of compressed images becomes large, but how quickly does this convergence occur?	I-Review	I-5	Review	578
How well does the method do if the VAE is trained using a smaller sample size?	I-Review	I-5	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall this is an interesting idea, and I believe it could be an excellent lossless compression scheme in scenarios where it's applicable.	O	O	Review	578
At the same time, there are many aspects where the paper could be strengthened by providing a more thorough investigation/evaluation.	O	O	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor:[line_break_token]- In Sec 2.1, using p for both a general pdf and the model to be learned (i.e., of both s_n and b_i) is potentially confusing.	O	O	Review	578
[line_break_token]- Sec 2.5.1 talks about using uniform quantization (buckets of equal width \delta y), but then Appendix B talks about using (nonuniform) maximum entropy discretization.	B-Review	B-6	Review	578
Which was used in the experiments?	I-Review	I-6	Review	578
In an implementation, the quantization strategy needs to be known by both sender and receiver too, so this is additional meta-information overhead, right?	I-Review	I-6	Review	578
[line_break_token]- The discussion in Sec 4.1 seems very speculative and not particularly convincing.	I-Review	I-6	Review	578

[line_break_token][line_break_token]To answer the specific points in the review, the BB-ANS bit stream does not include any overhead related to meta information.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	578
It was generated using the BB-ANS algorithm detailed in Sec 2.4, which has no provision for meta data.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	578
The PNG stream does, as pointed out, contain some meta-data, including (at least) the dimensions of and number of color channels in the images.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	578
The bz2 stream contains no metadata and was run directly on the raw bits in the (concatenated) images, with no shape or channel information.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	578

[line_break_token][line_break_token]A program that knows how to read/decompress PNG/bz2 formats is analogous to a program that implements BB-ANS and has access to a model.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	578
That is to say, a compressed bz2 bitstream is equally as incomprehensible as a BB-ANS bitstream without access to software which knows how the data was compressed.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	578
The fact that a person could open bz2 compressed files on any computer now is simply due to the popularity of that compression scheme.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]However, it's possible that a program that implements BB-ANS for encoding and contained the model weights could be larger than the analogous program required to encode/decode a format like bz2.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	578
We don't rigorously compare these file sizes, because we feel it's outside of the scope of our paper.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	578

However, we believe that it is essentially a modelling question, and the main focus of this paper is not on modelling questions, but on how to do compression given a model.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To find out how well BB-ANS would compress MNIST data using a model trained on ImageNet, we would not need to run BB-ANS compression with the model.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	578
Instead we could just examine the loss values (i.e. ELBO) obtained on MNIST data with a latent variable model trained on ImageNet.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	578
That is because we have shown that BB-ANS can losslessly compress data at a rate close to the ELBO value.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	578
Therefore this problem is not one related to BB-ANS directly, but instead a modelling question - can we train a model that would have low negative ELBO (loss) values for a wide range of images	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	578

This paper is built on a simple but profound observation: Frey's bits-back coding algorithm can be implemented much more elegantly when replacing arithmetic coding (AC) with asymmetric numerical systems (ANS), a much more recent development not known at the time, simply due to the fact that it encodes symbols in a stack-like fashion rather than queue-like.	O	O	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This simple observation makes for an elegantly written paper, with promising results on MNIST.	O	O	Review	578
I truly enjoyed reading it, and I'm convinced that it will spark some very interesting further work in the field of compression with latent-variable models.	O	O	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Having said that, I would like to point out some possible limitations of the proposed approach, which I hope the authors will be able to address/clarify:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	578
At the beginning of section 2.1, the authors define the symbols as chained conditionals prod_n p(s_n | s_1 ... s_n-1), which is generally permissible in AC as well as ANS, as long as the decoding order is taken into account.	B-Review	B-1	Review	578
That is, in AC, the symbols need to be encoded starting with the first symbol in the chain (s_1), while in ANS, the symbols must be encoded starting with the last symbol in the chain, because the decoding order is inverted.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In their description of BB-ANS, the authors omit the discussion of conditional chains.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
It is unclear to me if a conditioning of the symbols is feasible in BB-ANS due to the necessity to maintain a strict decoding order.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
It would be very helpful if the authors could clarify this, and update the paper accordingly, because this could present a serious limitation.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
For instance, the authors simply extrapolate the performance of their method to PixelVAE; however, this model is autoregressive, so a conditioning of symbols seems necessary.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
Similarly, in appendix A, the authors mention the work of Minnen et al (2018), where the same situation would apply, albeit one probabilistic level higher (on encoding/decoding the latents with an autoregressive prior).	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
Furthermore, in both cases (PixelVAE and Minnen et al), the symbols (s) and latents (y) are defined as jointly conditioned on each other (i.e., computing the posterior on one element of y requires knowledge of all elements of s, and computing the likelihood on one element of s requires knowledge of all elements of y).	B-Review	B-2	Review	578
This seems to imply that all operations pertaining to one data vector (i.e. to one image) would have to be done in a monolithic fashion, i.e.: first sample all elements of y from the stack, then encode all elements of s, and then encode all elements of y. Hence, if the goal is to compress only one image, the algorithm would never get to the point of reusing the "bits back", and the overhead of BB-ANS would be prohibitive.	I-Review	I-2	Review	578
It seems that in the MNIST experiments, the authors avoid this problem by always encoding a large number of images at a time, such that the overhead is amortized.	I-Review	I-2	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	O	O	Review	578
Similarly, although the compression of continuous-valued variables up to arbitrary precision is an exciting development and I do not wish to undermine the importance of this finding, it should be noted that the finer the quantization gets, the larger the potential overhead of the coding scheme will grow.	B-Review	B-3	Review	578
In practice, this would make it necessary to encode more and more images together, in order to still benefit from the method.	I-Review	I-3	Review	578
This would be a good point to make in the discussion.	I-Review	I-3	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4.	O	O	Review	578
The authors state in the appendix that learned compression methods like Ball√© et al (2018) and Minnen et al (2018) could be improved by using BB-ANS.	B-Review	B-4	Review	578
The potential gain of BB-ANS for these models seems rather small, though, as the entropy of y must be larger or equal to the entropy of y conditioned on s: H[y] >= H[y|s], the latter of which should represent the potential coding gain.	O	O	Review	578
Ball√© et al (2018), however, found that the bits used to encode the hierarchical prior (i.e. H[y]) is only a small fraction of the total bitrate, thus upper bounding the potential gains for this type of model.	B-Review	B-4	Review	578
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, I think this is a well-written, important and elegant paper, and I would like to see it accepted at this conference.	O	O	Review	578

The hypothesis in this paper is that the primary purpose of the cells of the V1 cortex is to perceive motions and predict changes in the local image contents.	O	O	Review	578
The authors show that by learning from image pairs from a continuous sequence, both V1-like features and motion operators can be learned.	O	O	Review	578
I found the hypothesis and formulation reasonable, the numerical results are supportive, it's actually interesting to see that the proposed model's motion prediction outperforms the other dedicated models.	O	O	Review	578

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Here are some issues could be addressed further:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	578
Section 3.3 introduces subvectors.	B-Review	B-1	Review	578
This implicitly introduces an independence assumption when combined with a motion operator.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
Then in section 5, the authors studied the dimensionality of subvectors.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
If the subspaces are assumed to be 2, then this independence regularization is quite strong.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
This may not support the authors' claim that the prediction of motion is enough to achieve V1-like features and I tend to conclude the V1-like receptive fields come from the implicit independence constraint.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
I'd suggest an additional ablation experiment to verify the impact of the subspace assumption.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578

Summary:[line_break_token]This paper proposes a representation model for describing local pixel displacement.	O	O	Review	578
The proposed model uses matrix multiplication for optical flow estimation, where an image is transformed into a vector and the local motion is modeled by a matrix.	O	O	Review	578
[line_break_token]The recommendation of this work is based on the following reasons.	O	O	Review	578
First, the motivation of the proposed method is not convincing.	O	O	Review	578
While the proposed ideas are interesting, it is not clear why this approach sheds light on our understanding of motion perception.	B-Review	B-1	Review	578

Or the authors simply take some ideas form V1 model and add a module to ‚Äúexplain‚Äù motion?	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
 Second, the experimental results are not sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.	I-Review	I-1	Review	578
[line_break_token]Major issues:[line_break_token]First, while it is interesting to use matrix multiplication to model motion, it is not clear why the motion between patches I_t[x] and I_{t+1}[x] can be approximated with linear transformation (Section 3.4).	B-Review	B-2	Review	578
Furthermore, it is not clear why the transformation M only depends on the displacement of the center pixel whereas different pixels in a patch I_t[x] could have different displacements.	B-Review	B-3	Review	578
[line_break_token]Second, the proposed model for optical flow estimation is only evaluated on the proposed V1Deform dataset.	B-Review	B-4	Review	578
If the authors position this paper ‚Äúmay shed light on our motion perception in primary visual cortex‚Äù, the authors certainly need to carry out sufficient psychophysical experiments.	I-Review	I-4	Review	578

Summary: This paper introduces a simple idea to optimize the weights of a weighted empirical training distributions.	O	O	Review	20133
The goal is to optimize the population risk, and the idea is to optimize a distribution over the training examples to maximize the cosine similarity between training set gradients and validation set gradients.	O	O	Review	20133
The distribution over the training set is parameterized by a neural network taking as arguments the[line_break_token][line_break_token]Strengths:[line_break_token]- The method is quite simple.	O	O	Review	20133
[line_break_token]- The results appear to be strong, although I am less familiar with the NMT baselines.	O	O	Review	20133

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weaknesses:[line_break_token]- I couldn't find a particularly clear description of the scoring networks architecture.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20133
Given that it observes the whole dataset, this seems like a critical choice that could have a big impact on the complexity of this approach.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20133
At the very least, this should be clearly reported, and I recommend a more thorough investigation of this choice.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20133
[line_break_token]- The authors report that their method takes 1.5x to 2x longer to run than the uniform baseline.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20133
Yet, they ran all methods for the same number of steps / epochs.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20133
It seems to me that a fairer comparison might be letting all methods enjoy the same total budget measure roughly by wall time.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20133
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Questions:[line_break_token]- I didn't follow why the computation of the per example gradient grad l(x_i, y_i, theta_t-1) is so onerous.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20133

This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach towards using data that present best correlation with a validation set‚Äôs gradient signal.	O	O	Review	20133

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Response:[line_break_token]It is correct that P_{test}(X, Y) is not observed, but practically in model training it is commonly more possible to collect a dev set that reflects the test scenario.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20133
To take the example of the multilingual NMT, in this case we would like to use training data from *many different languages* to improve the performance of *a particular low-resource language*.

This small dev set is possible to gather, even if we can‚Äôt gather a large training set in the language.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20133
P_{test}(X, Y) in this case is the distribution of the low-resource language, which is much better captured by the small D_{dev} from this low-resource language.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20133
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Similar settings can easily be thought of in other scenarios as well: in a domain adaptation setting we can obtain a small dev set in the target domain, or in a setting of training on noisy data we can often obtain a small clean dev set.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20133

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally, even if the training set and dev set come from *exactly* the same data distribution, likelihood on the dev set is still going to be a better estimator of test performance, as the model is not able to train on the dev set directly (which is why we use dev sets in standard machine learning setups in the first place).

This paper proposes a method to impose linear inequality constraints on neural network activations.	O	O	Review	20628
The method is implemented at initialization (by converting the H-representation to the V-representation) and during training (by modifying the network architecture).	O	O	Review	20628
Experiments on two setups (projection and VAE+projection on a checkerboard pattern on MNIST) demonstrate a 2-orders of magnitude speed-up with respect to test-time projection (computed with OSQP).	O	O	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The contributions claimed are:[line_break_token]* Novel technique to impose inequality constraints on neural network activations.	O	O	Review	20628
[line_break_token]* Significant speed-up w.r.t.	O	O	Review	20628
other techniques (at test time).	O	O	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, the approach is well motivated, and well-placed in the literature.	O	O	Review	20628
However, the experimental analysis does not support all the claims made by the authors as it focuses on a single dataset (i.e., MNIST) and single constraint (i.e., checkerboard pattern).	O	O	Review	20628
Additionally, while the authors argue that there is no manual trade-off between constraint satisfaction and data representation, the experiment in Fig.	O	O	Review	20628
3 appears to show that there is some manual trade-off (using box delay).	O	O	Review	20628
As such, I am currently inclined to give a "weak reject" score.	O	O	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The method is clear and the idea of using softmax to get a convex combination of the vertices of the V-representation to guarantee constraint satisfaction is reasonable.	O	O	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) The softmax used to satisfy the constraints is preceded by a batch normalization layer.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20628
I would expect batch normalization to interfere with the ability to saturate the softmax activation and thus prevent the network from reaching optimality.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20628
Could the authors provide experiments that justify the use of the batch normalization layer?	I-Review	I-1	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) An important factor that is unexplored in this manuscript is the softmax temperature.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20628
A good scheduling of that temperature could help the optimization.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20628
Have authors tried different temperature values?	I-Review	I-2	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) The use of softmax and the integration of the constraints as a network layer seem to create some difficulty during training (even with the rather simple checkerboard pattern used in the experiment).	O	O	Review	20628
The loss appears to reach some plateau (9% from optimal) and, thus, there appears to be some trade-off between reconstruction and projection.	O	O	Review	20628
The authors should provide more experiments to explain that trade-off.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20628
That trade-off is also visible on Fig.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20628
5 (the zero has a significantly different shape).	I-Review	I-3	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4) The method is solely compared to test time projection.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20628
Could the authors implement other techniques (if feasible)?	I-Review	I-4	Review	20628
e.g., OptNet.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20628
Overall, it would helpful to add more setups and different types of constraints (other than a last-layer projection; e.g., monotonicity).	I-Review	I-4	Review	20628
e agree that generally speaking a comparison with more methods is desirable.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	20628
However, as pointed out in the paper, the methods mentioned in the related work section don‚Äôt scale well and hence a comparison with our method is futile.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20628
Once the V-representation is computed prior to training, the subsequent training and inference phases have no significant overhead, whereas the other methods solve a sub-optimization problem at training time.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While the softmax is indeed a sensible choice for general linear inequalities, the homogeneous case presented in this paper in fact does not use a softmax.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20628
Since the feasible set for homogeneous linear inequalities is a polyhedral cone, all we need is a function that maps to positive values, which we can then use as conic combination parameters.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20628
We use the absolute value function for that purpose.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]You are right about pointing out that there is an implicit trade-off between constraint satisfaction and data representation in the box delay experiments (Sec.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20628
4.1).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20628

Although the contribution of the paper is potentially significant, some details are not clearly described.	O	O	Review	20628

However, I do not understand how to train the neural network to satisfy the constraint represented by rays, which is actually the core of the algorithm.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20628
I cannot see how satisfaction of constraints are guaranteed from the current description.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The empirical results show that the variational autoencoder trained with the proposed method can generate images that satisfy linear constraints.	O	O	Review	20628
However, the evaluation is limited to a checkerboad constraint, and other examples of practical linear constraints are not clear.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Due to the unclear algorithm description and limited empirical results, I give weak reject to the paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20628

[line_break_token][line_break_token]- In Section 4.1, it is stated that the constraint layer is added to the neural network.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20628

The paper proposes a new faster algorithm to add inequality constraints to neural layers.	O	O	Review	20628
The paper focuses on a novel constraining approach with seemingly superior scalability, and this is potentially a significant contribution.	O	O	Review	20628
However the paper does not motivate the constraining at all.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20628
I am baffled by this, since one would assume at least some benefits from all of this work could be presented.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20628
The only mentions are binarization of the predictions (which softmax already does), and monotonicity/convexity of neurons, with no proposed benefits.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20628
The running example of the paper is the chessboard constraint, which is either pointless (fig1) or harmful (fig5).	I-Review	I-1	Review	20628
Without justification and motivation the method has no merit and won‚Äôt have any impact in the machine learning community.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The monotonicity constraint could have a huge impact for MCMC sampling of neural parameters since it can reduce away all multimodalities of the posterior caused by reordering nodes or layers.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I had hard time following the method, and I its not clear how the neural network is modified and how backpropagation is performed with the contraints.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20628
It is not defined properly how the constrained optimisation works.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20628
Apparently additional neural layers are added that map z's to r's.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20628
The backpropagation in the constrained case is undefined.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20628
Here an algorithm box or schematic figure comparing unconstrained and constrained NN architectures would be extremely helpful.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20628
It‚Äôs also not explained how are modelling/domain constraints different.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper does not compare to the earlier constrained methods (Marquaz-Neila or OptNet), and thus there is no demonstration of the methods claimed superior computational efficiency.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20628
The paper also does not make very clear the different constraining approach advantages and tradeoffs.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20628
A comparison table would be help a lot.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20628
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The method is interesting, novel and seemingly efficient; but it is insufficiently defined, the method is not motivated and experiments are quite weak with little comparisons and no experiments with practical value.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20628

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Then, I decide to give a lower score that even the authors suggest that the main contribution is a definition of problem setting.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20335

he baselines do not employ CL techniques since the main motivation behind the baseline experiments was to assess the impact and extent of catastrophic forgetting in RNNs, which we believed to be a necessary first step to highlight continual learning issues in the context of sequential data processing (being the literature on this topic still in its infancy, differently from what occurs with feedforward networks and machine vision applications).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20335
Results show that, unsurprisingly, the standard models are severely affected by catastrophic forgetting, supporting our claim for novel architectures and approaches addressing the issue for sequential models.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20335
It is within this context, that we introduce GIM as a possible solution to the issue: of course, there can be others and based on different approaches, e.g. an adaptation of elastic weight consolidation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20335
Nevertheless, to the extent of our knowledge, there is, yet, no work in literature tackling catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for sequential problems.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20335
  [line_break_token]Nevertheless, we are taking in the reviewer suggestion and we will expand the analysis by adapting standard CL techniques to the recurrent scenario, assessing their performance in this novel context.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20335

The goal of this work is to best understand the performance and benchmarking of continual learning algorithms when applied to sequential data processing problems like language or sequence data sets.	O	O	Review	20335
The contributions of the paper are 3 fold - new benchmarks for CL with sequential data for RNN processing, new architecture introduced for more effective processing and a thorough empirical evaluation.	O	O	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Introduction: [line_break_token]I think a little more insight into why the sequential data processing CL scenario is any different than the vision scenario would be quite helpful.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20335
Specifically, it would be quite impactful to tell us more about what the additional challenges with RNNs for CL vs feedforward for CL are in the intro.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper is written as if the benchmark is the main contribution and the architecture improvement is just a delta on top of this, but it gets confusing when the methods section starts off with just directly stating the new architecture.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The algorithm seems like a straightforward combination of recurrent progressive nets and gated autoencoders for CL.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20335
Can the authors provide more justification if that is the contribution or there is more to the insight than has been previously suggested in prior work?	I-Review	I-3	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Figure 1 has a very uninformative caption.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20335
It also doesn‚Äôt show how modules feed into one another properly.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The motivation for why one needs GIM after one already has A-LSTM or A-LMN is not very clear?	B-Review	B-5	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall the contribution does seem a bit incremental based on prior work and the description lacks enough detail to properly indicate why this is a very important contribution?	B-Review	B-6	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experiments:[line_break_token]What does it mean to be application agnostic but restricted to particular datasets and losses?	B-Review	B-7	Review	20335
This doesn‚Äôt quite parse to me.	I-Review	I-7	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The description of the tasks is very informal and hard to follow.	B-Review	B-8	Review	20335
It‚Äôs not clear what exactly the tasks and datasets look like [line_break_token][line_break_token]‚Äúusing morehidden units can bridge this gap‚Äù -&gt; why not just do it?	O	O	Review	20335
Its a benchmark after all.	B-Review	B-8	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall the task descriptions should be in a separate section where the setup is described in a lot of detail and motivated properly.	B-Review	B-9	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The results in the experiments section are very hard to parse.	B-Review	B-10	Review	20335
The captions need much more detail for eg Table 2.	I-Review	I-10	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Could we also possibly have more baselines from continual learning?	B-Review	B-11	Review	20335
For instance EWC (Kirkpatrick) or generative replay might be competitive baselines.	I-Review	I-11	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall I think that the GIM and A-LMN and A-LSTM methods are reasonable although somewhat incremental.	B-Review	B-12	Review	20335
But the proposed benchmarks are pretty unclear and the results are a bit hard to really interpret well.	I-Review	I-12	Review	20335
It would also be important to run comparisons with more baselines and to provide more ablation/analysis experiments to really see the benefit of GIM/A-LMN or A-LSTM.	I-Review	I-12	Review	20335
I also think that the task descriptions should be much earlier in the paper and desribed in much more rigorous detail.	I-Review	I-12	Review	20335

he main difference between the sequential data processing scenario and the vision scenario is related to the fact that sequential processing requires the use of a memory that embeds the history of past inputs.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20335
Such memories have to be appropriately learned and preserved, making the sequential processing tasks clearly different than the vision tasks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20335
When it comes to CL, drifts in the input distribution could affect the hidden memory of RNNs.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20335

We will clarify this point in the Introduction.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The main concern of this work was to provide a set of common benchmarks for CL in sequential domains that are independent of domain-specific applications (e.g. NLP) against which existing and future models can compare their performances.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20335
We will better describe the experimental settings, reserving a specific section to the description of the tasks and datasets.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20335
Since they are the main contribution of this work, we agree that they should be better highlighted.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20335
[line_break_token]In addition, we extend the progressive approach and the gating autoencoder to the recurrent domain.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20335
At the best of our knowledge, no previous work proposed these two extensions for recurrent neural networks, nor they combine both into one end-to-end model.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The reason why the Augmented models need the autoencoders (e.g. from A-LSTM to GIM-LSTM) is that without the autoencoders is not possible to avoid the use of task labels at inference time.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	20335
GIM architectures can detect the correct module for inference, while Augmented modules alone only allow the transfer of useful, learned features from one module to the others.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experimental protocol is task-agnostic in the sense that we do not restrict the choice of datasets to a particular application (e.g. NLP), but instead, we proposed a set of general datasets (Copy and SSMNIST) that do not require any domain-specific technique.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	20335
Using this benchmarks, we can evaluate CL models while eliminating the idiosyncrasies of specific application domains.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In future versions, we will extend standard CL techniques to the RNN scenario and we will compare their performances against both naive RNNs and GIM.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20335
[line_break_token]We will also provide ablation studies highlighting the effects that autoencoders and inter-modules connections have on the overall performance of GIM	B-Reply	B-12	Reply	20335

Summary:[line_break_token][line_break_token]In this paper, the authors propose a new method to apply continual learning on sequential data.	O	O	Review	20335
The model is constructed by combining an Autoencoder and LSTM/LMN for each task.	O	O	Review	20335
The experiments on several datasets show the proposed model outperforms basic LSTM/LMN.	O	O	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Strength:[line_break_token][line_break_token]+ Sequential data widely exist in the real world, e.g., text, health records.	O	O	Review	20335
Thus, It is interesting to see that continual learning is used in sequential data.	O	O	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]+ The motivation of the proposed model is clear.	O	O	Review	20335
The authors save the learned knowledge in the hidden representation of LSTM/LMN.	O	O	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weakness:[line_break_token]- In this paper, the model size linearly increases since the number of LSTM/LMN and AE increases when a new task comes in.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20335
Thus, if the number of tasks is too large, the model size is quite big.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20335
In traditional continual learning settings, researchers may not always increase the model size for overcoming catastrophic forgetting.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20335
For example, if task 1 and task 2 sample from the same distribution, they can share the same LSTM/LMN and AE.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20335
Thus, it would be better if the authors can consider how to reduce the model size in the future version.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- In the experiments, the authors only compare the proposed model with simple LSTM or LMN.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20335
However, most continual learning methods can still be applied in this scenario, at least regularization based methods [1,2] can be simply applied in this scenario.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20335
The authors may need to compare the proposed method with them in the future version.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- It is better to compare it with a larger dataset.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20335
For example, in the natural language processing field, we can regard sentiment analysis on one language as one task.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20335
Then, we can construct the continual learning dataset for sentiment analysis.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor Comments:[line_break_token]It is better to improve Figure 3 by adding the x-axis label and y-axis label.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20335

e agree that the model size is the main limitation GIM.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20335
However, as you say, it is reasonable to assume that the number of hidden units of each module could decrease as the number of modules increases.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20335
Inter-modules connections can foster reuse of previous features, thus reducing the need to learn them from scratch.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20335
As far as we know, our work is the first example of a progressive model + gating AE applied to sequential data.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20335
Therefore, we decided to leave this extension out of the proposed paper, since we prefer to focus more on the benchmark design and the sequential nature of the data rather than the model architecture.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20335
We would like to propose GIM as a simple baseline that can be improved upon in several different directions.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree that it would be valuable to compare current CL techniques (e.g EWC) with GIM in order to further assess our approach.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20335
We will integrate some of the main techniques into our analysis and we will highlight the main differences between their application on a computer vision scenario and a sequential data processing scenario.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We struggle to understand what the use of a larger dataset (e.g. NLP / sentiment analysis) would add to our analysis.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20335
We recognize that it will be an important step in the development of full-fledged CL systems for sequential data processing, but we believe that in this first phase it would be better to focus on task-agnostic benchmarks before moving on to more complex scenarios.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20335
This choice allows us to highlight the CL properties of the model without the need to tailor it on a specific field of application, which often requires a complex preprocessing or the use of intermediate embeddings.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20335
By using simpler benchmarks, we reduce the probability to misinterpretation of results.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20335
This approach also makes it easier for other researchers to compare their results against our benchmark, since we do not require a large computational infrastructure to manage the experiments	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20335

The paper presents an approach to infer optimal strategies by learning the payoff function of 2 player games with a neural network Q(s, a), where a are the agent actions and s the context (e.g., action of the other player).	O	O	Review	871
The strategy is inferred by considering the inputs as free variables at test time and maximizing the learnt Q over its input variables by backpropagation.	O	O	Review	871
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The structure of the neural network in itself is not particularly original.	O	O	Review	871
The originality of the paper is to show that experimentally, in some 2-player games (and small sequential games, using an RNN), the policy that is inferred is close to a Nash equilibrium.	O	O	Review	871
While this is an interesting result in itself, the games used in the experiment are pretty easy to solve with existing algorithms, so the experimental evidence that this approach can work in practice in difficult cases is weak.	B-Review	B-1	Review	871
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The motivation and intuition fail to be convincing.	B-Review	B-2	Review	871
There is an excessive usage of analogies with intelligence and life in general that are not particularly enlighting (e.g., "Even though its hardware is damaged, the software in[line_break_token]the cloud (or the eternal soul, arguably) of the mosquito [...]", the value of the analogy between the cloud and the soul is unclear), and in the end there is no clear explanation of why it should work in practice.	I-Review	I-2	Review	871
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I think the paper in its current form is not ready for publication.	O	O	Review	871
More formal arguments and/or stronger experimental evidence are necessary.	O	O	Review	871
[line_break_token] 	B-Review	B-1	Review	871
Thank you for your opinion.	O	O	Reply	871
Indeed, there is much need to be done.	O	O	Reply	871
We agree with your opinion.	O	O	Reply	871
[line_break_token][line_break_token](1) The name of this machine is inappropriate since we didn't really invent a new kind of neural network, and we only exploit back propagation in an nontraditional way.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	871
We will cherish your opinion and re-coin the name of the machine.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	871
[line_break_token][line_break_token](2) The experiment result is not enough, indeed.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	871
We are working on the experiment result.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	871
The experiment result requires some time to come by (if there are randomly generated 100 tables, it takes quite a time), and we are working on it.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	871

The authors describe a method for endowing an artificial agent with causal reasoning  when completing goal-directed tasks.	O	O	Review	10003
Causal reasoning knowledge is encoded in a directed acyclic bipartite graph or slightly more complicated "master switch" variation.	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Essentially the method is:[line_break_token]  - train a model F to predict causal graphs (for which we have ground truth data) from trajectories generated with a heuristic,[line_break_token]  - train an policy \pi_G attending over the causal graph to solving tasks.	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]At inference time F an \pi_G are frozen and are evaluated on similar tasks to the ones in training, where however the (unseen) causal graph is new.	O	O	Review	10003
Thus the evaluation is in a meta-learning scenario, where the model has to learn how to learn to solve tasks.	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experimental setting is an agent controlling 5 or 7 switches in a simulated environment and observing 32x32x3 images of the environment.	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors report significant improvements over an existing baseline (Dasgupta et al (2019)).	O	O	Review	10003
The key to the improvements is in the iterative prediction of the causal graph (for F) and in having attention over the causal graph (in \pi_G).	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper is describes a very nice new method and makes interesting points about the role that causal reasoning can play in modeling agents in goal-directed tasks.	O	O	Review	10003
The paper is strengthened by improvements on existing baselines based on their intuitions.	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Questions:[line_break_token][line_break_token]* The authors claim that constructing an explicit causal structure, instead of a latent feature encoding, leads to better generalization in ‚Äúlong-horizon‚Äù tasks -- but they seem to only test on one task, fairly limited in complexity.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* On page 1, the authors claim that empirical evidence suggests the lack of correct causal modeling is an important factor for lack of generalization, generation of unrealistic captions, and difficulties in transfer learning.	B-Review	B-2	Review	10003
This seems to be a bit of an overreach.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10003
It‚Äôs possible that many empirical problems could be solved to a large degree by advances in machine learning without having to resort to explicit causal modeling.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* On page 2, is the reward function r the same for all MDPs?	B-Review	B-3	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Could it be said from the start that pi_I is heuristic and described in section 4.1?	B-Review	B-4	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* There seem to be strong assumptions on the structure of C that are only stated late in the paper.	B-Review	B-5	Review	10003
C is initially presented as an arbitrary acyclic graph, but from Figure 2 it appears to instead be a bipartite graph with N source nodes and N target nodes, and potential connections from any source node to any target node, where N is the number of actions.	I-Review	I-5	Review	10003
This should be explained early on.	I-Review	I-5	Review	10003

[Summary][line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper proposes an interactive agent that tries to infer the underlying causal structure by interacting with the environment; the authors called it "causal induction."	O	O	Review	10003
 The inferred graph will later help the agent complete goal-directed tasks referred to as a "causal inference" stage.	O	O	Review	10003
Notably, the agent directly learns from visual inputs.	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Both the induction and inference phases heavily rely upon the attention mechanism, which ensures that the agent only focuses on the relevant components of the causal graph.	O	O	Review	10003
During the induction phase, the agent incrementally updates the predicted causal graph through each interaction using an attention-based edge decoder.	O	O	Review	10003
During the inference phase, the attention bottleneck also showed to improve the agent's generalization ability.	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]They have shown that the proposed model outperforms several baselines in a synthetic environment that uses switches to control lights.	O	O	Review	10003
They have also demonstrated the model's generalization ability by operating on unseen causal graphs and new task goals.	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token][Major Comments][line_break_token][line_break_token]My primary concern about this work is the scope of its applicability.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For the causal induction phase, the proposed method makes a strong assumption that it can access the ground truth causal relationship during training.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10003
The authors can directly read this information from the synthetic environments used in this paper, yet, in more complex real-world situations, we might not know the underlying causal structure for supervised training the induction model.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For learning the goal-conditioned policies, the authors also assume that they have access to the ground truth causal graph.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10003
They use this information to generate the expert demonstrations, which, I presume, are deterministic and unimodal (correct me if I'm wrong).	I-Review	I-1	Review	10003
In the real world, a human may be able to infer the underlying causal structure from the observations by interacting with the environment and provide the demonstration data.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10003
However, the demonstration may be noisy or form a multi-modal distribution.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10003
While I agree that learning from demonstration is an effective way of guiding the learning of the policy, I'm not sure if the method can generalize to more realistic scenarios.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For inferring the causal graph, the authors also assume that they know the "cause" set and the "effect" set, which is already a DAG by construction.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10003
Instead of inferring the direction of the edge, they are solving an easier problem of deciding whether a directed edge between a "cause" node and an "effect" node exists or not.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10003
The assumption on the graph structure also limits the method's applicability, as, in the real world, the direction of the edge is not always known in advance.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10003
Smoking may cause lung cancer, but it is possible that lung cancer may make people smoke more.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I feel this paper makes strong assumptions on both the induction and inference stages, as well as the structure of the causal graph, which greatly limits the applicability of the approach.	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Detailed Comments][line_break_token][line_break_token]I also have a few questions regarding the details of this paper.	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In Section 3.1, the authors said that "N is the number of actions in the environments," which is a bit confusing.	B-Review	B-2	Review	10003
Before this point, the authors did not discuss the relationship between the size of the graph and the size of the action set.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10003
Only until Section 3.2 did I realize that N is the number of both "cause" set and "effect" set.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10003
It would be better to discuss the size of the graph and the action set at an earlier position.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10003

We address each comment below:[line_break_token][line_break_token]Scope of applicability: It is correct that we assume access to the ground-truth causal structure in the training of our final model.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	10003

However, both baselines failed to match the performance of our final model (see Figure 5).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10003
It implies that the use of ground-truth causal graph is crucial for learning efficiency and high performance of our model.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10003
In more realistic scenarios, we would have to investigate more effective reinforcement learning algorithms as a replacement to imitation learning to reduce the reliance on expert demonstrations.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In addition, it is true that we assume that the graph nodes are known and focus on predicting the directed edges.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10003

[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚ÄúHow is the expert planner implemented?‚Äù: Using the goal state and current state, the expert computes the necessary change in state, and using the ground truth causal graph plans a sequence of actions which would achieve this change.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	10003
Hence the expert policy is deterministic and unimodal - however note we train using DAgger with epsilon greedy exploration, so rather than receiving demonstrations, we query the expert online while training the policy.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10003
We have added this clarification to Section 3.3.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚ÄúWhat will happen if we learn the goal-conditional policy from scratch?‚Äù: We tried to train the policy with reinforcement learning (RL) on image inputs, but it did not converge.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	10003
Therefore, we trained an RL baseline which learned a single policy using memory and ground-truth low-dimensional states (no images) called ‚ÄúMemory (RL/Low dim)‚Äù, and its performance was still low (See Figure 5).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	10003

So one trained model is not invariant to the ordering of cause/effect nodes in the graph, but the method in general should extend to larger environments/lights/room configurations (assuming you train one model per configuration).	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	10003

This is a paper about a very interesting topic, involving both learning (in a supervised way) to induce a causal graph and taking advantage of it in a goal-conditioned policy.	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This is clearly a timely topic and I loved the motivations of the paper.	O	O	Review	10003
My main difficulty was with understanding the actual architecture and its motivation, but I believe this is fixable but is a serious impediment to being able to evaluate the paper, as it stands.	O	O	Review	10003
I was a bit disappointed to see that training is mostly supervised (both providing the ground truth causal graph and an oracle policy as target) but on the other hand it is impressive to obtain these results with raw images as input and the comparative results are good.	O	O	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, I would like to better understand the insight behind the architecture of F and several things would need to be clarified to enable reproducibility and making sense of the equations.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10003
I would start by suggesting to add an example illustrating why simply seeing a (state,next-state,action) triplet is sufficient to obtain a bit of evidence in favour of a particular edge of the graph.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10003
Since this is supervised learning of the causal graph, I imagine that the semantics of the node is predetermined, which is a bit disappointing (but doing otherwise would be understandably much more challenging).	B-Review	B-2	Review	10003
Second, I don't understand the structure of the causal graph C. What are the input nodes?	B-Review	B-3	Review	10003
action values?	I-Review	I-3	Review	10003
action x state cross-product?	I-Review	I-3	Review	10003
What are the output nodes?	I-Review	I-3	Review	10003
Effect variables?	I-Review	I-3	Review	10003
Why would C be NxN and not have different input and output dimensions?	I-Review	I-3	Review	10003
All this really needs to be clarified.	I-Review	I-3	Review	10003
Based on the 1st eqn of page 4 (PLEASE NUMBER YOUR EQUATIONS!!!)	I-Review	I-3	Review	10003
it looks like C is number of actions by number of actions, which does not seem consistent with any reasonable interpretation.	I-Review	I-3	Review	10003
The authors should also clarify how R is computed (if it is a straight difference of the encoder output, put up an equation for example) and how delta e is computed.	B-Review	B-4	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Then in sec 3.2 the authors talk about a weighted sumn involving selected edges.	O	O	Review	10003
I imagine this is soft-attenetion but it needs to be clarified with equations and explanations.	B-Review	B-5	Review	10003
What is the "content" associated with each edge e which gets averaged in the soft attention?	I-Review	I-5	Review	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I found a possibly interesting parallel between the focus of attention on one edge of the graph  at a time (figure 3) and the ideas of the "Consciousness Prior" (Bengio 2017, on arXiv) bottleneck (where only a small tuple of variables, corresponding to an edge here, is considered at each time step in order to reason, plan, decide etc).	B-Review	B-6	Review	10003
The fact that in the experiments this attention mechanism helps seems to support the sparsity of dependencies hypothesis underlying the consciousness prior.	O	O	Review	10003

‚Äù: Figure 6 in the Appendix includes a qualitative example of the graph induction, including how a specific change in state can map to a predicted edge update to the graph.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	10003
The core idea is that from state and next-state one can compute the change in state which came from the action, which would imply a certain edge should exist in the graph.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚ÄúI imagine that the semantics of the node is predetermined:‚Äù Correct, the semantics of the node are predetermined to be one of the switches or one of the lights.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	10003
The causal induction stage amounts to predicting the directed edges between switch nodes and light nodes from visual observations.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚ÄúI don't understand the structure of the causal graph C:‚Äù We have restructured section 4.1 to have a paragraph titled ‚ÄúCausal Graph‚Äù which describes the causal graph in more depth.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	10003
We include the following details: First, in the One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-One settings the graphs are bipartite, consisting of N ‚Äúcause‚Äù nodes corresponding to the switches, and M ‚Äúeffect‚Äù nodes corresponding to lights.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10003
In practice in our experiments we use M=N, hence the N x N space of mappings between causes and effects.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10003
We agree the without this description the fact that the graph is N x N may be confusing, and we have made sure to clarify this in the text.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10003
The causal induction stage corresponds to identifying the correct edges out of the possible N x N relationships.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10003
In the Masterswitch stage, the graph is tripartite, with an additional mapping between one ‚Äúmaster‚Äù switch to all other switches.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚ÄúThe authors should also clarify how R is computed (if it is a straight difference of the encoder output, put up an equation for example) and how delta e is computed.	O	O	Reply	10003
‚Äù: Yes, R is computed by computing the straight difference between the encoder output, we have added an equation (Equation 1) for this in Section 3.1.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	10003
Delta e is the output of a fully connected layer which has shape 1xN, which is a mapping of edge strengths to the N effect variables (lights).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	10003
Then this is combined with the attention as described in Equation 3 (We have now numbered our equations).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	10003
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚ÄúWhat is the ‚Äòcontent‚Äô associated with each edge e which gets averaged in the soft attention?‚Äù: For the goal conditioned policy, the soft-attention is over the N ‚Äúeffect‚Äù variables (lights), which is applied in a weighted sum resulting in N edge strengths from the N ‚Äúcause‚Äù variables, which is what the policy uses when picking actions.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	10003
Essentially, this is focusing only on the edges which go into the relevant ‚Äúeffect‚Äù variable based on the current state and goal.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	10003

B-Reply	B-6	Reply	10003

This paper is concerned with how to determine whether a set of data points are from a given distribution.	O	O	Review	20633
It uses the so-called typical set to transform the problem to determining whether the data points lie in the typical set of the given distribution.	O	O	Review	20633
It proposes a statistical test using the empirical distribution of model likelihoods to determine whether inputs lie in the typical set if the considered model.	O	O	Review	20633
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The motivation of the work is very clear, and the paper is well organized.	O	O	Review	20633
The basic idea of using the typical set to check whether given data points are from a given distribution seems sensible, as guaranteed by Theorem 2.1.	O	O	Review	20633
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My concern is about the performance of the proposed method compared to alternatives.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20633
First, a standard approach to the considered problems seems to be the two-sample tests (or its approximations or variations), so it would be desirable to compare the typical set-based approach with the two-sample test approaches theoretically.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20633
In particular, given that you have to allow some error when using typical sets, what is exactly the advantage of the proposed approach?	B-Review	B-3	Review	20633
 Second, according to the empirical results (Section 5), the proposed method does not seem to clearly outperform alternatives such as KS-test.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20633
In this case, a better justification of the reliability of the proposed approach would be helpful.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20633
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I acknowledge I read the authors' response and other reviews and would like to keep my original rating. (	O	O	Review	20633
I agree that the t-Test and KS-test were probably first used by the authors, but at the same time it is natural to adopt them; that is why I considered them as baselines.)	O	O	Review	20633

 We are glad that you found the work‚Äôs motivation ‚Äúvery clear‚Äù and the paper ‚Äúwell organized.	O	O	Reply	20633
‚Äù  Hopefully we can dispel your reservations below.	O	O	Reply	20633
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Reply	20633
Performance in Comparison to Baselines:  Firstly, let us clarify that the only relevant baseline from the goodness-of-fit-testing literature is the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy (KSD).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20633
 As stated in Sec 3.1, we are aware of no other GoF test that can be widely applied across all types of deep generative models.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 As for our test vs KSD, they perform roughly the same in all cases except for the PixelCNN trained on FashionMNIST.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 KSD is unable to detect MNIST as OOD, and our test is unable to detect NotMNIST as OOD.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 Yet an additional factor that differentiates the two is runtime: KSD is drastically slower, requiring an evaluation time (with M representing the batch size) in addition to the cost of computing derivatives through the model.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 Our method is after the likelihoods have been computed from the model.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 With runtime considered, the results clearly favor our method.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
[line_break_token]Secondly, the t-Test and KS-test baselines are not really ‚Äòcompetitors‚Äô as they are (i) proposed by us and (ii) closely based on our typicality test.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 The t-test is just the typicality test with, and the KS-test is comparing all moments, whereas our typicality test is comparing just the first.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 Thus, these tests should perform comparably!	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 The fact that the KS-test and ours perform so similarly can be seen as positive evidence for our method since it validates that the first moment (i.e. entropy) is truly the critical one for testing OOD.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 [line_break_token]Thirdly, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) baseline is not a `'valid' competitor as it is performing a two-sample test, not a GoF test.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 We provide MMD only as a reference point to see how testing against compares to testing against.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 Lastly, the annulus method [Choi et al 2019] is simply what our test reduces to in the special case of the-typical set for isotropic Gaussians (which we state on p 6).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Reply	20633
 ‚ÄúA standard approach to the considered problems seems to be the two-sample tests‚Äù: This is incorrect.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20633
 Two-sample tests assume the setting vs, with being the inaccessible underlying generative process.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20633
 Rather, we are testing  vs, with being a model to which we have access.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20633
 Yet we do report an MMD baseline in the experiments in anticipation of readers wondering how a two-sample test would perform in the same setting.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20633
 We find it to perform comparably except in the same setting mentioned for KSD above: for the PixelCNN trained on FashionMNIST, MMD is unable to detect MNIST as OOD, and our test is unable to detect NotMNIST as OOD.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20633
 Note that this performance was only able to be achieved when we derived the MMD kernel from the generative model.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20633
 Otherwise, performance was strictly worse than our test.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20633
  Moreover, MMD is much more expensive to compute as it is (as mentioned on p 6).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20633

‚Äù  But to summarize our contributions once more: (1) we propose typicality as an explanation for the OOD phenomenon in deep generative models, (2) derive a GoF test widely applicable across all deep generative model classes and with better runtime than KSD, (3) show that this test, despite it using only the first moment of the empirical likelihoods (which makes runtime cheap), is able to detect the OOD set in many of the cases reported by [Nalisnick et al 2019].

[line_break_token][line_break_token]My major concerns about the proposed method are whether "the typicality set" could be faithfully applied in the small data regime.	O	O	Review	20633
The authors point me to the interesting Figure 4, which shows that it basically achieves converged performance when or smaller numbers for some problems.	O	O	Review	20633
I think this experiment is a strong support for the proposed method.	O	O	Review	20633
[line_break_token][line_break_token]However, I don't agree that the M=1 Gaussian case acts as a strong support for the method.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20633
As I said, for some other wired distribution, it is difficult to interpret what the M=1 Typicality set becomes.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20633
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors also clarify the difference between different baselines.	O	O	Review	20633

[line_break_token][line_break_token]##########################[line_break_token][line_break_token]Recent works have shown that out-of-distribution samples can have higher likelihoods than in-distribution samples for some generative models.	O	O	Review	20633
To explain this phenomenon and to tackle the problem for OOD detection, this paper adopts "typical sets" for identifying in-distribution samples.	O	O	Review	20633
Specifically, a "typical set" is a set of examples whose expected log likelihood approximate the model's entropy.	O	O	Review	20633
For a Gaussian distribution, the paper finds that a single point typical set locates exactly in the \sqrt{d} radius, which is usually favored over the high-likelihood origin.	O	O	Review	20633
Then the paper uses the "typical set" to perform OOD for a batch of examples.	O	O	Review	20633
Empirically they demonstrate competitive performance over MNIST and natural image tasks.	O	O	Review	20633
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Typical set seems natural for out-of-distribution detection.	O	O	Review	20633
An important property is that, if one draws a large number of independent samples from the distribution, it is very likely that these samples belong to the typical set (basically Theorem 2.1).	O	O	Review	20633
 However,  for small n, this property doesn't hold anymore, which leaves here a questionmark whether "Typical set" can be used for OOD detection in small n regime.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20633
As the author argues, for Gaussian distribution when n=1 the typical locations are those \sqrt{d} radius points.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20633
But this doesn't justify the "Typical set".	I-Review	I-1	Review	20633
If the distribution is some non-Gaussian wired distribution, the typical locations doesn't seem to make sense at all.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20633
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Following the previous argument above, the Typical set method requires to perform OOD for a batch of examples.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20633
In contrast, the Annulus method can be directly applied to one single test example.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20633
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Empirically, the Typically set doesn't demonstrate obvious advantages compared to the baselines.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20633
For both MNIST and natural image tasks, it seems that all methods behave similarly.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20633
For comparing such big tables, I would recommend adding a column showing the average ranks among all methods.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20633
Beyond that, standard OOD tasks usually evaluate methods using AUROC and AUPR (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2017).	B-Review	B-4	Review	20633
Is it possible to also include such metrics ?	I-Review	I-4	Review	20633
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Theorem 2.1 is confusing.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20633

[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20633
Small Behavior:  You are correct in that Thm 2.1 only holds for sufficiently large, and therefore it is not obvious that a typicality-based test behaves correctly in the small regime.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 Firstly, we emphasize that GoF testing for deep generative models is still a completely open problem even in the large-M regime.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 As KSD is the primary competitor and scales as, even a procedure that performs well for large M is a contribution.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 And as can be seen in Figure 4, our test works near perfectly for, and this prompted us to focus the main experimental section on the regime.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 [line_break_token]Now returning to the main point, we have two pieces of evidence for the test‚Äôs correctness for small.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 The first is theoretical: examining the Gaussian case, the-typical set is, the shell of radius.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 This is quite a narrow region of the support, which speaks to the inapplicability of Thm 2.1.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 Yet as we are given only one test instance, such a restriction seems to be the most appropriate choice.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633
 It is clearly better than picking the mode, for instance.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20633

 Performance in Comparison to Baselines:  Firstly, let us clarify that the only relevant baseline from the goodness-of-fit-testing literature is the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy (KSD).	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20633
 As stated in Sec 3.1, we are aware of no other GoF test that can be widely applied across all types of deep generative models.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20633
 As for our test vs KSD, they perform roughly the same in all cases except for the PixelCNN trained on FashionMNIST.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20633
 KSD is unable to detect MNIST as OOD, and our test is unable to detect NotMNIST as OOD.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20633
 Yet an additional factor that differentiates the two is runtime: KSD is drastically slower, requiring an evaluation time (with M representing the batch size) in addition to the cost of computing derivatives through the model.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20633
 Our method is after the likelihoods have been computed from the model.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20633

This major limitation has not been addressed in the experiments.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20633
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper, does a good job in finding the OOD data points if the likelihood histograms do not overlap using the typicality notion.	O	O	Review	20633

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, I think the paper needs some improvement in terms of discussing the robustness of the test with respect to model properties; otherwise, it is just another typicality set explanation of why DGMs may produce high likelihood values for OOD samples which has already been mentioned in previous work.

This paper demonstrates some limitations of censoring for privacy with respect to sensitive attributes.	O	O	Review	20482
In particular, the authors show that censoring reduces, but does not eliminate, the ability of a neural network to infer private/sensitive attributes, e.g. to infer race from a model aiming to predict gender.	O	O	Review	20482
Part of the proposed method is a component that performs de-censoring using an auxiliary dataset.	O	O	Review	20482

The submission proposes a method for face de-identification.	O	O	Review	1388
[line_break_token]A network is trained to transform an input face image to simultaneously stay close to the low- and mid-level representations  while maximising the distance of the high-level representation of the input image in a face recognition network.	O	O	Review	1388
Additionally an adversarial loss and reconstruction losses both in terms of the input image as well as its horizontal and vertical gradients are employed.	O	O	Review	1388
[line_break_token]The network learns to transform faces to be maximally different in identity from a given reference image while preserving low-level features.	O	O	Review	1388
Thus, at inference the network can de-identify face images from arbitrary new people given a single reference image of each person.	O	O	Review	1388
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The method is evaluated in three different ways.	O	O	Review	1388

[line_break_token]b) In a fine-discrimination experiment human subjects are asked to re-identify faces from a given reference image among five dark-haired caucasian males.	O	O	Review	1388

How long are the videos used for evaluation a), what is the exact study protocol ?	B-Review	B-1	Review	1388

Are the evaluation networks trained on the same dataset as the loss network?	B-Review	B-2	Review	1388
If yes it is not surprising that the generated images can fool the networks as they represent the same data as the loss network and I would like to see the evaluation for networks not trained on the same dataset as the loss network.	I-Review	I-2	Review	1388
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.)	O	O	Review	1388
The method is optimised to maximise confusion of the identity while preserving low and mid level features.	B-Review	B-3	Review	1388
This leads to good de-identification if the set of identities from which to retrieve is densely sampled in the space of low-level features.	I-Review	I-3	Review	1388
I.e. if in the set of identities from which to identify a person there exist many people with similar low-level features.	I-Review	I-3	Review	1388
However, there are many conceivable scenarios in which the number of possible identities from which to retrieve is far smaller.	I-Review	I-3	Review	1388
To de-identify in such scenarios, it is necessary to apply much stronger transformations to the face to obscure the identity of a person.	I-Review	I-3	Review	1388
It would be great if this dependency between the strength of the transformation that needs to be applied and the reference set of identities from which to retrieve the identity of a given person could be explicitly discussed in the submission.	I-Review	I-3	Review	1388
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4.)	O	O	Review	1388
The emphasis on performance for video de-identification is somewhat misleading as the method does not seem to include any particular effort to explicitly improve video performance.	B-Review	B-4	Review	1388
It is great that the method also seems to work for video, but I cannot see strong evidence that it strongly outperforms pre-existing methods on video performance (they might also just work well out-of-the-box).	I-Review	I-4	Review	1388

Introducing Precision Gating (PG), the first end-to-end trainable method that enables dual-precision execution of DNNs and is applicable to a wide variety of network architectures.	O	O	Review	20025
[line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	20025
Precision gating enables DNN computation with a better average bitwidth to accuracy tradeoff than other state-ofthe-[line_break_token]art quantization methods.	O	O	Review	20025
Combined with its lightweight gating logic, PG demonstrates the potential to reduce DNN execution costs in both commodity and dedicated hardware.	O	O	Review	20025
[line_break_token]3.	B-Review	B-7	Review	20025
Unlike prior works that focus only on inference, precision gating achieves the same sparsity during back-propagation as forward propagation, which reduces the computational cost for both passes.	O	O	Review	20025
[line_break_token][line_break_token]These contributions are novel and experimental evidence is provided for multiple networks and datasets.	O	O	Review	20025
The paper is well-written and provides insightful figures to showcase the strengths of the present method.	O	O	Review	20025
Related work is adequately cited.	O	O	Review	20025
The paper does not contain much theory, but wherever possible equations are provided to illustrate in detail how the method works.	B-Review	B-9	Review	20025
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experimental results are shown for the datasets CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and ShiftNet-20, and ImageNet with ShuffleNet V2 0.5x.	O	O	Review	20025
On both datasets, PG outperforms uniform quantization, PACT, Fix-Threshold and SeerNet in terms of top-1 accuracy and average bitwidth.	O	O	Review	20025
[line_break_token]What I am missing is information about the variability of results, since there are no error bars.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20025
Are the results averaged over multiple trials (if yes how many?),	I-Review	I-1	Review	20025
and is there a difference in variance between the methods?	I-Review	I-1	Review	20025
I realize that adding standard deviations to all results in the tables might be infeasible, but a qualitative statement would be interesting.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20025
In particular, the random initialization of the hb bits could play a bigger role than lb bits.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20025
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The two variants of PG, with and without sparse backpropagation are also investigated, showing that sparse backpropagation leads to more sparsity.	O	O	Review	20025
To show that the resulting lower average bitwidth gained with PG leads to increased performance, the authors implement it in Python (running on CPU) and measure the wall clock time to execute the ResNet-18 model.	O	O	Review	20025
Speedups are shown for every layer when using PG.	O	O	Review	20025
Evidence from other papers is cited to argue that similar speedups are expected on GPUs.	O	O	Review	20025
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Even though at the moment it is unclear to me how statistically significant the results are, and I strongly recommend commenting on this in the paper, I think the idea of PG and the demonstrated benefits make the paper interesting enough to be accepted at ICLR.	O	O	Review	20025
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I also have a few questions that I could not get completely from the paper:[line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	20025

This paper presents an interesting quantization technique that is, unusually, end-to-end trainable and not just an inference technique.	O	O	Review	20025
According to the experiments, the method achieves better performance and computational savings as compared to other quantization method baselines.	O	O	Review	20025
The results are admirably demonstrated on a variety of models, including CNN and RNN-based neural nets, as well as on several datasets in different domains, including ImageNet, CIFAR10, and PTB.	O	O	Review	20025
We see the method seems to generalize across all of these.	O	O	Review	20025

I feel this work is being released prematurely and could use some more polish to help sell the method better.	O	O	Review	20025

[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Why only report on ResNet-18?	B-Review	B-1	Review	20025
It would be far more useful to show numbers against ResNet-50.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20025
It would also be useful to show the non-quantized best results on these models and datasets.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20025
[line_break_token]* I wish more effort had been spent to analyze the experiments.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20025
For example, I am not sure I understand the effects of the threshold on this method.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20025
What happens when it's set manually?	I-Review	I-2	Review	20025
[line_break_token]* How exactly is computation cost savings calculated so crudely?	B-Review	B-3	Review	20025
If it uses B_avg, why not calculate the bitwidth per layer and sum things up?	I-Review	I-3	Review	20025
Using B_avg strikes me as being quite crude.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20025

For example, the floating-point ShiftNet-20 CIFAR-10 model has an accuracy of 89.4%.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20025
In Table 4, we report the floating-point PPW of the LSTM PTB model in the caption.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20025
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To empirically show PG works on more models, we apply PG to ResNet-56 and ResNet-32, then train it on the CIFAR-10 dataset.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20025
The training settings are the same as described in Section 4.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20025
In the latest revision, the additional results are shown in Table 7 in Section A.2.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20025
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Compared to the 8-bit PACT baseline, PG achieves 4x computational cost reduction on both models at the same level of prediction accuracy.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20025
The sparsity in ResNet-56 (98.2%) and ResNet-32 (96.3%) are higher than that (90.1%) in ResNet-18 for CIFAR-10 dataset.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20025
Compared to the fix-threshold baseline, the accuracy of PG increases by 42.5% for ResNet-56 and 46.4% for ResNet-32 with the same computational cost.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20025
This increasing accuracy gap empirically shows that PG also works well on larger DNN models.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20025

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Reply: We can consider the threshold in PG as a measurement of the importance of an output feature.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20025
If the MSB result exceeds the threshold, it means that the corresponding output feature is important.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
We will then compute this important feature in high precision.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
In the bell shaped activation distribution, the larger a threshold is, the less likely an output feature will exceed the threshold, and thus the more output features will be computed using reduced precision.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
Hence a large threshold is desired to reduce the computational cost.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
We introduce a threshold loss to make the threshold approach a large value.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
Moreover, the threshold is also optimized by minimizing the accuracy loss.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
As a result, the trainable thresholds are learned to jointly minimize the threshold loss and the accuracy loss.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We‚Äôve already compared PG to manually set thresholds.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
The results of which are shown  in Table 1 under columns of ‚ÄúFix-Threshold‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
We notice that manually set thresholds yield a much lower model accuracy compared to PG at a similar computational cost.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the latest revision, we also show the results of sweeping a series of manually set thresholds on the ResNet-18 for CIFAR-10 with=3/2 in Table 8 in Section A.2.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
As the threshold decreases from 3 to -4, the average bitwidth in the update phase consistently increases.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
This is expected because we compute more output features in high precision.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
The model prediction accuracy therefore increases.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
However, compared to the manually set threshold, PG achieves a much better model accuracy (91.2%) with a larger sparsity (90.1%).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20025
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q3: "How exactly is computation cost savings calculated so crudely?	O	O	Reply	20025
If it uses B_avg, why not calculate the bitwidth per layer and sum things up?"	O	O	Reply	20025
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Reply: The average bitwidth is a good indicator for the compute efficiency when we run PG on customized hardware as it reflects the energy consumption per arithmetic operation.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20025
Prior art proposed by Song et al (ISCA‚Äô2018) cited in the paper also adopts the same metric of compute efficiency.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20025
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree that calculating the bitwidth per layer and summing them up is another good metric.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20025
However, it is essentially equivalent to the average bitwidth reported in the paper.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20025
The average bitwidth is obtained by normalizing the sum of the bitwidth per layer using the total number of features in the network.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20025

Below please find our response to your questions/comments: [line_break_token][line_break_token]Q1:[line_break_token]As we search for a neural architecture distribution instead of tuning specific hyperparameters, we did not use any validation set for model selection in our work.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	396
With our method, we are able to optimize the neural architecture without using a validation set.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	396
However, it is true that other authors have used a validation set for NAS to prevent overfitting.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	396
Our NADS can be considered as a Bayesian version of previous NAS methods.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	396
It naturally enables uncertainty quantification and alleviates potential overfitting issues.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	396

When we wrote the paper, we did not think that this issue needed further restatement.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	396

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q3:[line_break_token]As we are investigating likelihood-based models, other metrics that can be considered would be other forms of penalized likelihood.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	396
WAIC has been shown to be robust to the issue of assigning high likelihoods to OoD data, as likelihoods of OoD data have been shown to have higher variance compared with that of the training data.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	396
WAIC is uncertainty-aware for training Bayesian ensembles and WAIC-based training leads to more robust performance with respect to potential uncertainty.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	396
Hence, it is the most appropriate metric for our NADS training.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	396
This was actually observed empirically as we have tried other penalized likelihood methods that computes the likelihood through adversarial perturbations, and they do not perform as well as WAIC-based NADS does.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	396
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q4:[line_break_token]As stated in our manuscript, we trained a likelihood estimation model on these 4 datasets.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	396
The likelihood estimation model is then used to discriminate OoD samples from other datasets.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	396
For example, the model trained on MNIST was used to discriminate MNIST from the OoD datasets K-MNIST, F-MNIST, and NotMNIST.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	396

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q5:[line_break_token]- It is true that variation is already considered in (1).	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	396
However, (1) was estimated by sampling.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	396
In the search stage, this was done by sampling multiple architectures.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	396
In the evaluation stage, the sampling was done by considering an ensemble of architectures, each architecture giving a sample to estimate (1).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	396
[line_break_token]- As our NADS aims to search for a distribution of architectures that can better estimate the estimation uncertainty, the ensemble of models can be considered the empirical estimates from NADS.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	396
 [line_break_token]- We have added additional ROC and PR curves (Figure 4, page 7) to our manuscript to more clearly show the effect of the ensemble size on the model's performance.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	396
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q6:[line_break_token]Standard NAS algorithms do not search for a distribution of architectures.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	396
As such, they are not able to optimize the WAIC as it needs to be approximated through sampling, or further approximated to make optimization tractable.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	396
Moreover, as we are not constructing any validation set from OoD data, they should not perform well in OoD detection, as they will likely run into the problem of assigning high likelihood to OoD data.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	396
We believe that searching for architecture distributions is indeed one of the unique contributions of our NADS.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	396

[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper throws neural architecture search at the problem of out-of-distribution detection.	B-Review	B-1	Review	396
Rather than searching over multi-class classifier architectures, and using the result for OOD detection, they instead search for generative model architectures.	I-Review	I-1	Review	396
[line_break_token]The approach appears to work on some of their cherry-picked OOD datasets.	I-Review	I-1	Review	396
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I give this paper a 3 because they are quite possibly only showing their strongest results and not giving a complete picture, and there are numerous small errors throughout the paper.	O	O	Review	396
[line_break_token]After a more thorough evaluation, the technique will likely not look strong on datasets such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100.	B-Review	B-7	Review	396
[line_break_token]This is acceptable since they are comparing density estimators vs multi-class OOD detectors, the latter of which has been vastly superior for many years.	I-Review	I-7	Review	396
[line_break_token]Their technique brings density estimators within striking distance of multi-class classifier perofrmance, but the paper must give a complete picture.	I-Review	I-7	Review	396
If these issues are fixed, the paper is easily a 6 or an 8, depending on the results of currently unshown OOD datasets.	I-Review	I-7	Review	396
It is acceptable if their technique gets and 55% AUROC for CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100 while multi-class classifiers with Outlier Exposure get 96%.	I-Review	I-7	Review	396
It is OK because this technique appears superior to other generative models, which have lagged far behind.	I-Review	I-7	Review	396
Currently the paper leaves the impression that this is not only leapfrogging past previous density estimators, but that it also is beating multi-class classifiers.	I-Review	I-7	Review	396
This likely isn't true.	I-Review	I-7	Review	396
We need to see performance on other OOD datasets.	I-Review	I-7	Review	396
[line_break_token]I am willing to increase my score from a 6 to an 8 even if the results are negative.	I-Review	I-7	Review	396
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The CIFAR-10 model should have to detect OOD samples from CIFAR-100, Rademacher/Bernoulli noise, and Gaussian noise.	I-Review	I-7	Review	396
In addition, they should train a model on CIFAR-100 since many OOD detection techniques exhibit much worse behavior on CIFAR-100, compared to CIFAR-10 or MNIST or SVHN.	I-Review	I-7	Review	396
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In summary, I give this a 3 due to critical flaws, but if these are rectified, the paper will likely deserve a 6 or 8.	O	O	Review	396

[Overview][line_break_token][line_break_token]In this paper, the authors proposed a new format of representation called scene programs, to describe the visual scenes.	O	O	Review	471
To extract the scene programs from scenes, the authors exploited the off-the-shelf object detection and segmentations model, mask r-cnn to extract all objects and the corresponding attributes from the images, and then detect groups for those objects, which are then used to generate the programs which matches the input scenes.

This paper investigates a descriptive representation of scenes using programs.	O	O	Review	471
Given an input image and an initial set of detections obtained from bottom-up detectors a sequence to sequence network is used to generate programs in a domain specific language (DSL).	O	O	Review	471
The authors consider a dataset where simple primitives are arranged in layouts in 3D scenes with varying material and color properties.	O	O	Review	471
They argue that the scene representation lead to better generalization on novel scene types and improve over baselines on image analogy tasks.	O	O	Review	471
The paper is well written but the evaluation and technical novelty is weak.	O	O	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, the use of scene programs is not a contribution of this paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	471
Going beyond the works cited in the related work section, several recent works have proposed and investigated the advantages of program synthesis for shape generation (e.g., CSGNet Sharma et al CVPR 2018 and Scene derendering, Wu et al CVPR 2017), visual reasoning (Modular networks, Andreas et al 2015), among others.	I-Review	I-1	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]At a high-level the motivation of the program level representation for the considered tasks is not highlighted.	B-Review	B-2	Review	471
It seems that an attribute-based representation, i.e., the output of the mask R-CNN detector that describes the image as a collection of objects, material properties, and their positions and scales is a sufficient representation.	I-Review	I-2	Review	471
The higher-order relationships can be relatively easily extracted from the detections since the images are clean and clutter free.	I-Review	I-2	Review	471
A baseline approach where the program synthesis was performed using search and grouping should be compared with.	I-Review	I-2	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The considered tasks are relatively simple achieving 99.5% token-level accuracy.	B-Review	B-3	Review	471
The evaluation beyond the synthetic datasets is fairly limited and it is unclear how well the method generalizes to novel images in clutter and occlusion.	I-Review	I-3	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In summary, the paper makes a number of observations that have been motivated in a number of prior works, but the contributions of this paper is not highlighted (e.g., over neural scene derendering).	O	O	Review	471
The main claim that higher-order relationships are being modeled is not apparent due to the simplicity of the scenes being considered.	B-Review	B-4	Review	471
For example, the program blocks being considered are somewhat arbitrary and a comparison with a clustering based grouping approach should have been evaluated.	I-Review	I-4	Review	471
The experimental evaluation is weak in several aspects.	I-Review	I-4	Review	471
The generalization to real images is anecdotal with only two examples shown in the Figure 7.	I-Review	I-4	Review	471

Scene programs allow us to perform such tasks in an efficient and intuitive way.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471

[line_break_token][line_break_token]We agree that it‚Äôs important to discuss the alternative approach, where the program synthesis is performed using search and grouping.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471
There are two possible approaches for a structured search over the space of programs, both of which would be too slow for our task:[line_break_token]- Constraint solving: we would have to use an SMT solver.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471
Ellis et al [1] used SMT solvers to infer 2D graphics programs, and takes on the order of minutes per program.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471
As 3D scenes (with attributes) have a much larger search space, such an approach would not be able to find a solution in reasonable time.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471

Overview[line_break_token]This paper proposes a type of regularization for recurrent networks, with the goal of encouraging particular dynamical structures (in this case, line attractors) in the dynamics of the networks.	O	O	Review	471
The proposed regularization penalty is only applied to a subset of the recurrent units; the motivation for this is to allow neurons not contained in the subset to learn different structures.	O	O	Review	471
The paper applies this regularization method on three example machine learning sequence tasks: an addition task, a multiplication task, and sequential MNIST classification, as well as on learning a 2-D dynamical system model of a bursting neuron with two different timescales.	O	O	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Major comments[line_break_token]I have a number of serious concerns about the paper's motivation, logic, and experiments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- First, the paper motivates the proposed regularization as a way to encourage the network to have line attractor dynamics.	B-Review	B-1	Review	471
In particular, the paper dismisses gated architectures as not being interpretable, stating that LSTMs and GRUs "are complicated and tedious to analyze from a DS perspective." (	I-Review	I-1	Review	471
pg 2).	I-Review	I-1	Review	471
However, there is recent work both theoretical (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01005)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01005)</a> and empirical (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08549)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08549)</a> that analyzes these gated architectures from a DS perspective.	O	O	Review	471
In particular, these papers demonstrate that LSTMs and GRUs are perfectly capable of learning line attractors.	B-Review	B-1	Review	471
Given that it is possible to analyze gated architectures as dynamical systems, the overall motivation of the paper is much weaker.	I-Review	I-1	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The paper proposes a squared penalty on subsets of the weights in the recurrent network as a way to encourage line attractor dynamics.	B-Review	B-2	Review	471
However, it is not clear to me that this is sufficient.	I-Review	I-2	Review	471
In particular, unless the subset of the network that implements the line/plane attractor is completely disconnected from the rest of the network, then the overall dynamics may not contain a line attractor (the units will interact with the unregularized units).	I-Review	I-2	Review	471
Also, the proposed regularization penalty only penalizes the diagonal elements of the A matrix to be close to 1--but shouldn't the off diagonal elements also be penalized to be close to zero?	I-Review	I-2	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Moreover, the paper makes no mention of the Jacobian of these recurrent networks.	B-Review	B-3	Review	471
The eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the recurrent networks determine the behavior of the linearized system around fixed points--specifically, eigenvalues with real part close to 1 will exhibit slow dynamics (approximate line attractors along those dimensions).	I-Review	I-3	Review	471
It seems to me that a much more natural way of encouraging line attractor dynamics is to place a regularization penalty on the Jacobian itself (which is analytically tricky, but numerically more plausible with modern autodifferentiation software).	I-Review	I-3	Review	471
Regardless, the authors should compare the eigenvalues of the recurrent networks' Jacobian when using their regularization method vs without it.	I-Review	I-3	Review	471
Does the proposed regularization encourage the Jacobian of the resulting networks to have eigenvalues close to 1?	I-Review	I-3	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The paper compares the proposed method with a number of vanilla RNNs with different initializations, and an LSTM.	B-Review	B-4	Review	471
However, a critical missing baseline is simply an RNN with l2 regularization on the weights (standard regularization in the literature).	I-Review	I-4	Review	471
This baseline is important to determine if the proposed regularization simply helps because it is an l2 penalty on the weights (note that none of the other baselines have regularization).	I-Review	I-4	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The paper motivates the method as trying to study line attractor dynamics, but then does not apply them to tasks where line attractors are required.	B-Review	B-5	Review	471
For example, the addition and multiplication tasks require discrete memories, not line attractors.	I-Review	I-5	Review	471
The bursting neuron approximation (2D dynamical system) also does not involve a line attractor.	I-Review	I-5	Review	471
However, there definitely exist tasks both in neuroscience (e.g. sensory integration in decision making, path integration in navigation, etc.)	I-Review	I-5	Review	471
and in machine learning (c.f.	I-Review	I-5	Review	471
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10720)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10720)</a> that use or require line attractors.	O	O	Review	471
The motivation of the paper would be much better tested on these tasks.	B-Review	B-5	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor comments[line_break_token]- The authors comment at the beginning of page 4 that by setting A=I, W=0, and h=0, the network contains a line attractor, but the more precise language would be to state that the network contains an N-dimensional plane attractor, where N is the number of units.	B-Review	B-6	Review	471
Typically, 'line attractor' refers to a 1-dimensional manifold of fixed points along which the system can integrate inputs, but perturbations off of the line attractor are not remembered (decay back to the line attractor).	I-Review	I-6	Review	471
 Of course it is possible to analyze GRU and LSTM networks from a dynamical systems (DS) perspective, and of course they could be trained to exhibit line attractors, limit cycles, chaos, and all of that ‚Äì no surprise, since after all, formally speaking, they are powerful discrete-time nonlinear DS themselves!	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	471
[line_break_token]Our point, however, is that they are much more tedious to analyze and understand than the PLRNN architecture we are propagating, for reasons we had given in the 3rd pg.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	471
of sect.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	471
3.1: For the PLRNN we can track fixed points, limit cycles, and their stability *analytically*, and we can rather easily translate them into equivalent continuous time systems which brings additional advantages for analysis (see Suppl.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	471
6.1.2); none of this is easily possible for LSTM or GRU!	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	471
[line_break_token]We are also not the first to point out the complexities of LSTM/GRU as a caveat to their training and analysis: In fact, to a large degree this motivated also the development of identity-initialized (e.g. Le, Jaitly, Hinton 2015) and orthogonal/ unitary RNN (e.g. Arjovsky, Shah, Bengio 2016) for solving long-dependency problems!	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- 'A' is a diagonal matrix (see below eq.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	471
1), so off-diagonal elements *are* zero.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471
The ‚Äòtrue‚Äô off-diagonal elements are in W, and these are indeed regularized toward zero (see eq.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471

Hence, the configuration is indeed driven toward forming a line attractor subspace (see also Suppl.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471

2 &amp; 3) that the method *does work* and that its success is dependent on the regularization!	O	O	Reply	471
[line_break_token]As another note on the side, even if there would be a *perfect* line attractor subspace, it would still integrate external inputs (see eq.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	471
1) and form an internal memory of them, and this memory could still be read out by the other units which receive inputs from this subspace!	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- First, please note that a line attractor is a continuous set of neutrally stable fixed points, not just a single fixed point (and hence not just a single Jacobian to be evaluated).	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	471
More importantly, because our model is piecewise linear, all Jacobians in our case are strictly given by the matrices ‚ÄòA+W*D‚Äô as defined in Suppl.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	471

[line_break_token]Also note that we have been careful to talk only about ‚Äòline attractor dimensions‚Äô ‚Äì the overall dynamics *should not* be a line attractor, as this would rule out phenomena like chaos or limit cycles.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Except for vanilla RNN, we have included into our comparison only other methods that have been explicitly devised to exhibit long short-term memory properties, and hence these are the crucial comparisons in our minds.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	471
A simple L2 penalty on the weights would not convey any such mechanism, but of course it‚Äôs easy to do and we are happy to add it to the revised manuscript.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- This last statement may reveal a fundamental misunderstanding about the aims of our work: The motivation of our method is *not* the study of line attractors (or systems based on them), we merely use line attractors as an effective mechanism for storing continuously valued variables in memory!!	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	471
Figs.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	471

[line_break_token]That we can successfully train our RNN even on challenging systems like the bursting neuron (3D, see 6.1.5), which the RNN then freely (!)	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	471
reproduces when simulated, we think is actually a major feat (not a flaw), and something we have not quite seen elsewhere in the literature so far.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	471
[line_break_token]Besides, recent proposals (see ref.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	471
above) for battling the vanishing/exploding gradient problem like orthogonal/unitary RNN or initialization-based approaches effectively use line attractors as well for their long-term memory (even LSTM and GRU essentially employ line attractors for their memory cells, at least that is what it comes down to in dynamical systems terms; i.e., linear recursive operations which map the values onto themselves).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	471
Our approach is clearly more along the lines of the recent orthogonal and identity-initialized RNNs that attempt to avoid the complexities of LSTM/GRU networks.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	471
However, orthogonal RNNs *cannot* produce many dynamical systems phenomena (like chaos; see e.g. Kerg et al 2019), and this is what motivates our specific approach which is expressive enough to reproduce chaotic phenomena, multi-stability etc.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	471
[line_break_token]We will attempt to make this clearer in the revision.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor: For N&gt;2 it is also not a plane anymore, that is why we used the term ‚Äòline attractor dimensions‚Äô initially, although, admittedly, we sometimes referred to this simply as ‚Äòline attractors‚Äô for short later in the text.	O	O	Reply	471

The paper proposes a regularization scheme to improve the ability of RNNs in capturing long-range dependency in the latent space.	O	O	Review	471

The special RNN model studied in the paper has strong connections with neuro-dynamics models.	O	O	Review	471

It‚Äôs not clear to me why VAE or variational RNN type of approaches cannot be used in this setting.	I-Review	I-1	Review	471
One might think of replacing the Gaussian prior with more complex distributions.	I-Review	I-1	Review	471
The inference procedure can also be significantly simplified with variational inference.	I-Review	I-1	Review	471
[line_break_token]- The step-wise annealing together with EM inference is not scalable, which prohibits the model from applying to large-scale sequence modeling tasks.	B-Review	B-2	Review	471

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Re the ‚Äò-‚Äò points:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Absolutely, VAE/var.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	471
RNN could be used as well, and in fact we have already implemented &amp; tested this in our group.	O	O	Reply	471
However, at this point EM produces much better results regarding reconstruction of the underlying dynamical system, possibly because in our algorithm &amp; model we can compute expectations over latent states, as well as parameters given these expectations (M-step), exactly &amp; analytically, and rely on efficient fixed-point iterations for maximizing the ELBO in the E-step (see sect.	O	O	Reply	471
6.1.3).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	471
Hence our algorithm is sort of optimized for this problem of reconstructing nonlinear dynamical systems, exploiting the piecewise linear formulation (PLRNN), and therefore is to be preferred for smaller-scale problems as often encountered in physics or neuroscience.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	471
In fact, we observed that it gets away with much less data than what we would need for our VAE implementation!	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Yes, this is the downside of our algorithm (and also what ultimately motivated us to re-implement the whole approach in a VAE framework).	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	471
We point out, however, that our algorithm is still linear in T (the length of the time series) since we can effectively exploit the block-tridiagonal structure of the Hessian for inversion (see also Paninski et al 2010, J of Comput.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471
Neurosci.).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471
So for smaller-size problems as in physics or neuroscience experiments, we clearly recommend using EM for the reasons mentioned above (the more exact approach requiring less data), but for larger-scale problems one probably would need to switch to a variational framework.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We are happy to include this discussion of up- &amp; downsides of the different approaches in the revision.	O	O	Reply	471

This paper presents a regulariser that encourages the formation of line attractors in RNNs.	O	O	Review	471
This regulariser works on a neuroscience-motivated formulation of RNN, bringing the Jacobian of the dynamic system close to identity.	O	O	Review	471
This paper is well-written, with a good coverage of background material from machine learning to computational neuroscience.	O	O	Review	471
 While the alleviating the exploding and vanishing gradient problem for simple RNNs is an interesting direction, I think the empirical results are not sufficient to support claims in the paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper starts by criticising initialisation and reparametrisation-based techniques.	O	O	Review	471
However, I am not convinced why such methods limit the expressive power of RNNs.	B-Review	B-2	Review	471
In fact, one may argue that initialisation is a milder constraint compared with an explicit regulariser, since regularisation affects the entire learning process.	I-Review	I-2	Review	471
It seems that such initialisation requires less tuning (i.e., just identity) compared with the regulariser weights (a rather wide range of choices).	I-Review	I-2	Review	471
Either a theoretical justification or strong empirical results are required to support this claim.	I-Review	I-2	Review	471
However, both are missing in the current paper.	I-Review	I-2	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experiments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, the baseline results for even toy problems (e.g., addition) are unclear.	B-Review	B-3	Review	471
Despite the results in the paper show the advantage of the proposed method, direct comparison with results from other papers are missing.	I-Review	I-3	Review	471
For example,  when the T &gt; 150 the results from Le et al, 2015 (A Simple Way to Initialize Recurrent Networks of[line_break_token]Rectified Linear Units) were much better compared with baseline results in the paper.	O	O	Review	471
This could be due to the smaller size of the models (40 vs 100 hidden units in Le et al).	B-Review	B-3	Review	471
For clear and direct comparison in this case, models with comparable size should be used in these experiments.	I-Review	I-3	Review	471
Despite this, I wonder why the performance of addition and multiplication seem even worse than the much smaller model reported in Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997? (	I-Review	I-3	Review	471
see table 7 and 8)?	I-Review	I-3	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Actually, it would be helpful to test the proposed method on more practical tasks such as language (at least synthetic ones) and speech modelling, which would bring more impact on the wider community.	B-Review	B-4	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A few technical questions:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Is the form of eq.	B-Review	B-5	Review	471
1 necessary, or can the method be adapted for the more standard formulation of RNN used in machine learning?	I-Review	I-5	Review	471
It seems that A can be interpreted as a skip connection[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Eq.3 can simply be referred to as ‚Äúsoftmax‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Please comment on the algorithm in section 3.4 in comparison with more standard variational approaches, such as stochastic variational inference with reparametrisation as in variational RNNs (e.g., Chung, et al 2015, A Recurrent Latent Variable Model for Sequential Data).	B-Review	B-6	Review	471
Is ‚Äústepwise annealling‚Äù always necessary?	B-Review	B-7	Review	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Eq.	B-Review	B-8	Review	471
7 as a measurement of the match between trajectories still depends on z. Is there an additional expectation over p(z)?	I-Review	I-8	Review	471
Is ‚Äúfreely simulated trajectories‚Äù the prior over trajectories?	I-Review	I-8	Review	471
If so, what‚Äôs the form of this prior?	I-Review	I-8	Review	471
he limitations of orthogonal/unitary RNN are well illustrated in the recent work by Kerg et al (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12080)," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12080),</a> but we also have a formal proof that orthogonal RNN cannot exhibit certain dynamical systems phenomena like, e.g., chaos (briefly, among other things, because they do not have diverging eigen-directions).	O	O	Reply	471
We would be happy to add this proof to the manuscript if that is considered useful.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding initialization, in all our experiments all the initialization-based approaches always performed worse than the regularization, and we suspect this is the case since over the course of training the initial condition often simply gets lost (after all, the training [parameter updating] constitutes a stochastic dynamical systems process as well), and with it the ability to express long short-term memory.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471
This certainly will depend on the complexity of the task, the length of the delays used, and the amount of noise/stochasticity in the process, however, where we‚Äôd expect that our approach gains more and more of an edge as T, noise, and task complexity increase (playing against pure initialization-based approaches).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Re experiments, we will attempt to add runs with 100 units at least for iRNN and rPLRNN, and comparable # of parameters for LSTM, if we‚Äôll manage in the time available for the revision!	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	471
[line_break_token]We emphasize, however, that we settled on 40 units since this appeared to optimize the bias-variance tradeoff in our case, and hence is a reasonable choice from a statistical learning perspective.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	471
Given this, we put all different models on equal footing by equalizing their degrees of freedom as much as possible.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	471
[line_break_token]We are not quite sure why the results for LSTMs in H&amp;S97 are better than ours, but will surely look into this ‚Äì perhaps it‚Äôs related to the optimizer we used (Adam) or the specific learning protocol or ‚Ä¶; we note that we will provide all our code (now available via the Dropbox link) publicly on github, so anyone is free to check our code and results for possible clues.	O	O	Reply	471
[line_break_token]We aimed to standardize and make comparable the protocols &amp; conditions among all RNN models tested to the largest degree possible, however, so specific performance differences we get in comparison to the literature are likely to affect all models in our competition, including the one advocated by us.	O	O	Reply	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While language modeling would certainly be interesting, it‚Äôs probably not something we‚Äôll achieve in the short time available for revision; we used the three benchmarks which we feel are the ones most widely used in the literature on the vanish./expl.

problem, with language modeling less commonly employed.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	471
[line_break_token]Ultimately, however, our interest is much more in recovering underlying nonlinear dynamical systems in a fully generative sense (Fig.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	471
3).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	471
In our minds we have achieved a major step here, but it appears this point unfortunately got somewhat lost perhaps by the focus on machine learning benchmarks in the first part.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]On the technical questions: [line_break_token][line_break_token]Yes, the model could largely be rewritten in ‚Äòstandard machine learning form‚Äô (see lines below eq.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	471
1, by a change of variables).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	471
However, the specific separation of A and W we chose, at least in theory enables a line attractor to be formed across the whole support of the variables (the whole real line), and therefore should be beneficial for this purpose.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	471
Moreover, it makes an explicit connection to models used in computational neuroscience, a feature it appears that referee #3 liked.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	471
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Softmax: Yes, true; we wanted to be explicit here, but are happy to change this and spare one standard equation.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	471

RNN: Very fair point, please see our reply to referee #3 who brought up the same issue.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	471
[line_break_token]In brief, we actually did implement the same model using a variational approach and the re-parameterization trick, but it performs (much) worse than the EM-based algorithm which is specifically designed for nonlinear dynamical systems reconstruction, and which also requires (much) less data.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	471
The annealing may not always be necessary, but at least for the purpose of reconstructing dynamical systems it improves performance by orders of magnitude (see Koppe et al 2019 PLoS Comp.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	471
Biol.)!	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	471

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Re eq.	O	O	Reply	471
7, measure of match between attractor geometries: Yes it depends on z, but the whole ‚Äòmeasure‚Äô is across state space, not time.	B-Reply	B-8	Reply	471
And yes, by freely simulated we mean drawing samples from the generative model, i.e. the prior p(z), and using that to produce samples from p(x|z).	I-Reply	I-8	Reply	471
The prior is determined by our specific model formulation, eq.	I-Reply	I-8	Reply	471
1, i.e. at each time step t it is conditionally (on z_{t-1}) Gaussian, but overall the prior across latent trajectories will be a high-dimensional mixture of piecewise Gaussians (owing to the piecewise linear, ReLU-based structure of the RNN).	I-Reply	I-8	Reply	471

This paper presents and interesting twist to adversarial examples: given a trained neural segmentation model, with slight changes to the input image that given a segmentation model, it is possible to change the segmentation prediction of certain classes or even individual objects without significantly changing the predictions to anything else.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weaknesses: the methods utilized are relatively similar to earlier works on adversarial examples, so the novelty of the approach is not very high.	B-Review	B-1	Review	105

[line_break_token][line_break_token]We would like to address the point of meaningful quantitative comparisons:[line_break_token]* One main reason we used no other adversarial attacks in comparison was that we were restricted to targeted attacks (in order to achieve a specific target segmentation) and related work is typically non-targeted.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]------------------[line_break_token]The authors propose a generative model with a hierarchy of latent variables corresponding to a scene, objects, and object parts.	O	O	Review	105
The method is evaluated on a synthetic dataset with manual inspection, MSE, and object counting performance.	O	O	Review	105
The method can form bounding boxes around objects and parts in the examples that are shown, and the MSE is similar to that of a VAE.	O	O	Review	105
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The idea of decomposing a probabilistic model hierarchically is potentially interesting, but this paper has drawbacks in terms of experimental quality, significance, and presentation.	O	O	Review	105
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-- Experiments -- [line_break_token]The experiments are done on a manually constructed synthetic dataset, so it is not clear whether the proposed method would work in more realistic or more challenging settings.	B-Review	B-1	Review	105
For instance, the dataset was constructed using a recursive process which probably does not resemble a realistic distribution of objects and their parts, and the parts are well-separated within the object.	I-Review	I-1	Review	105
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experiments on the synthetic dataset are not thorough, and could be more interesting with ablations, evaluating performance as the dataset parameters vary (e.g. number of objects, amount of occlusion), better baselines, and an evaluation metric rather than manual inspection.	I-Review	I-1	Review	105
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-- Significance --[line_break_token]With respect to significance, the formulation is fairly straightforward and builds off of previous techniques introduced in e.g. SPAIR.	B-Review	B-2	Review	105
The lack of demonstrating usefulness on a downstream application limits this paper's significance; for instance the SPAIR paper used the generative model as a front-end for a card game and Atari game.	I-Review	I-2	Review	105
The paper should more clearly demonstrate the benefits/tradeoffs of the hierarchical aspect.	I-Review	I-2	Review	105
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-- Presentation --[line_break_token]The paper leaves many terms undefined so the paper is not self contained, e.g. the 'problem of routing', 'memory buffer', 'memory template', 'variational memory addressing', 'spatial transformer' (missing a reference here).

The updated paper does look more convincing, but my main concern remains - all considered datasets and tasks are synthetic and specifically made for the method.	B-Review	B-2	Review	105
I think experiments on more real data would be crucial to show the potential of the method.	I-Review	I-2	Review	105

[line_break_token][line_break_token]---[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper proposes an unsupervised approach to learning objects and their parts from images.	O	O	Review	105
The method is based on the "Attend, Infer, Repeat" (AIR) line of work and adds a new hierarchy level to the approach, corresponding to object parts.	O	O	Review	105

On these datasets the method successfully infers the object-part structure and can parse and reconstruct provided images.	O	O	Review	105
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While the general topic of the paper is interesting, I do not think it is fit for publication.	O	O	Review	105
First and foremost, the experiments are very incomplete: the method is only evaluated on two custom synthetic datasets and not compared against any baselines or ablated versions of the method.	B-Review	B-1	Review	105

[line_break_token]2) The method works on the tasks studied in the paper, including relatively challenging scenarios with 3D occlusions or ambiguity in assigning parts to objects.	O	O	Review	105

It is unclear if it would apply to more practical situations.	I-Review	I-2	Review	105
While I agree that at the high level the question of decomposition of object into parts is interesting, it is still important to connect research in this direction to potential practical applications.	I-Review	I-2	Review	105
Where could the proposed method be used?	I-Review	I-2	Review	105
Perhaps in some control tasks, such as robotics?	I-Review	I-2	Review	105

One might argue that baselines do not exist since there are no methods addressing the same task.	I-Review	I-2	Review	105
Generally, it is the job of the authors to come up with relevant baselines to show that the proposed model actually improves upon some simpler methods.	I-Review	I-2	Review	105
One variant of obtaining baselines is via ablating the proposed model.	I-Review	I-2	Review	105
Another is by taking prior approaches, for instance object-based ones without the part decomposition, and showing that the part decomposition allows to improve upon those in some sense.	I-Review	I-2	Review	105

Contributions: this submission proposes a generative framework which employs a hierarchical decomposition of scene, objects and parts.	O	O	Review	105

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Assessment:[line_break_token]- The proposed model and learning framework are closely related to previous work (AIR, SPAIR).	B-Review	B-1	Review	105
The authors replaced the "sequential processing ... with single forward pass", which requires the number of objects to be fixed.	I-Review	I-1	Review	105

Both the tree structure and the latent variables are inferred for each static image in the dataset.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	105
One way to visualize the tree is to draw bounding boxes around objects and their constituent parts according to the inferred tree structure and pose vectors.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	105

Human evaluation supports that the pair of the generated images and target labels are more natural to humans than prior attack algorithms.	O	O	Review	10157
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper should be rejected due to the lack of motivation to create adversarial examples less detectable by humans automatically.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10157
Attackers can manually select target labels and apply targeted attacks.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10157
In the target label selection, attackers can choose less detectable labels if necessary.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10157
It is encouraged to provide some applications where attackers want to create less detectable adversarial examples in label space without manually assigning target labels.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10157
[line_break_token][line_break_token]==========[line_break_token]Update:[line_break_token][line_break_token]After reading the authors' responses, the motivation of the paper became clearer.	O	O	Review	10157
I will not get surprised if this paper is accepted.	O	O	Review	10157
However, all reviewers still share concerns about the importance of the problem tackled.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10157
I think the paper needs to suggest more applications and emphasize the value of the goal in the main paper before being published.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10157
e thank the reviewer for the time , and would like to answer the reviewer‚Äôs questions as follows:[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, we want to explain our motivation for this work.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	10157
Our method is an untargeted attack, not a targeted attack.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
To the best of our knowledge, most papers in adversarial attack community focus on untargeted attacks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
But exiting untargeted attacks don‚Äôt care about the misclassified-label in the label space so that the misclassified-label may be very unreasonable.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
However, many effective defense methods [1,2] have been published.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
Unreasonable labels will cause the users detect the attack and take defensive measures to let the attack fail (just as introduced in Section 1).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
So creating an attack without regards to the target label is adverse for an attacker.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
Therefore, we propose this LabelFool method in order to help an untargeted attack not to be defensed.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
We recommend to create carefully automatically designed target label when doing untargeted attacks[line_break_token][line_break_token]Second, there are many applications where ‚Äúattackers want to create less detectable adversarial examples in label space without manually assigning target labels‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
Please see Figure 9 in Appendix E in the new version.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
Taking face recognition system for entrance as an example, there will usually be a guard as ‚Äúa human inspector‚Äù to check whether the man A who is entering the gate is the same as the system shows.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
In this case, if the model just misclassifies A and C, the person who looks totally different from A, the attack will be detected easily.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
But LabelFool aims to let the model misclassify A and B who looks like A as shown in Figure 9.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
If the guard doesn‚Äôt identify carefully, he will let a fake B in and this error brings great potential security risks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
So as an attacker, it is necessary to generate imperceptible examples in the label space for this task.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
But how does the attacker know who is the one looks like A in such a huge face database?	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
LabelFool can help him much in this application.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Third, we appreciate your suggestion about applying this method to other applications, we will do this in our future work, but now, we just introduce this idea, provide a tool and conduct experiments on simple tasks to prove the feasibility of this idea.

This paper describes a technique for creating adversarial images where the added perturbations are not only imperceptible to machines, but also to human observers.	O	O	Review	10157
The authors describe why this might be beneficial.	O	O	Review	10157
The method works by finding labels that are not too far from the source image's ground-truth labels, and moving the source image in that direction.	O	O	Review	10157
To find the target label, the authors use a threshold on the confidence of predicted ground-truth labels.	O	O	Review	10157
The authors test their algorithm using a newly proposed metric of how much a method allows imperceptibility for a human observer.	O	O	Review	10157
They show that their method creates images whose perturbations are more impercetible to humans, compared to other methods, but are also imperceptible to machines.	O	O	Review	10157
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My concern is as follows: If the misclassification is between A and B, and they are related classes, is the attack so bad?	B-Review	B-1	Review	10157
And what are the scenarios in practice when a user simply wants to create an attack, without regards to the target label chosen?	I-Review	I-1	Review	10157
I imagine normally the attacker has a target label in mind, so the part of the paper that chooses a target label is not very useful; and this is the main element of novelty, since the rest of the method is from DeepFool, as the authors explain.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10157
Some specific use cases of this methods should be discussed.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10157

The concept of ‚Äúadversarial examples‚Äù was first proposed in 2014 [1] and defined as ‚ÄúWe find that applying an imperceptible non-random perturbation to a test image, it is possible to arbitrarily Change the Network‚Äôs Prediction. ‚	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
Ä¶ We term the so perturbed examples ‚Äòadversarial examples‚Äô.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
‚Äù That is to say, adversarial examples are the ones misclassified by the network (by adding imperceptible perturbations).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
As long as the prediction is changed by the perturbation, the perturbed example is called ‚Äúadversarial example‚Äù no matter how the prediction is far from the ground truth.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
Therefore, we think that each adversarial example should be treated equally.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
There is no ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù attack.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
There is only ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù and ‚Äúfailed‚Äù attack.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Second, to the best of our knowledge, most papers in adversarial attack community focus on untargeted attacks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
Unfortunately, exiting untargeted attacks just focus on getting the networks failed (with imperceptible perturbations in the image space).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
They don‚Äôt care about the misclassified-label in the label space so that the misclassified-label may be very unreasonable.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157

Unreasonable labels will cause the users detect the attack and take defensive measures to let the attack fail (just as introduced in Section 1).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
So ‚Äúcreating an attack without regards to the target label‚Äù is adverse for an attacker.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
Therefore, our method is applicable when an attacker conducts untargeted attack and hope it not to be detected.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
We recommend to create carefully automatically designed target label when doing untargeted attacks.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157

This paper proposes a method for constructing adversarial attacks that are less detectable by humans, by changing the target class to be a class similar to the original class of the image.	O	O	Review	10157
The resulting attack methodology is then studied in terms of its imperceptibility in label space, and shown to be less perceptible in label space to human observers, while not coming at a cost in image space.	O	O	Review	10157
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper presents compelling evaluation of the method and does seem to succeed in proving that their proposed attack satisfies the stated goal.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10157
However, it appears as though this goal is somewhat counter to the main point of adversarial examples---indeed, if the label is reasonable to a human, then what makes the adversarial example adversarial?	I-Review	I-1	Review	10157
The main threat in adversarial examples research seems to be that it is possible to induce predictions that are arbitrarily different from humans' on natural-looking in puts.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10157
Thus, changing the label to something that a human actually agrees with would actually reduce the impact of the adversarial attack.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10157
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In order to improve the paper, I would suggest applying the same (or similar) methodologies to other areas of ML security where imperceptibility in label space is commonly desired---for example, in data poisoning attacks or backdoor attacks.	B-Review	B-2	Review	10157
In general, such attacks are much more likely to be "inspected" by humans, and so imperceptibility in both label and image space is very desirable.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10157
However, I suspect that this would require significant effort and changes to the paper, and so for now I recommend rejection.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10157
e thank the reviewer for the time and some good suggestions, and would like to answer the reviewer‚Äôs questions as follows:[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, there is some misunderstanding about ‚Äúadversarial examples‚Äù.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	10157
This concept was first proposed in 2014 [1]. It is defined as ‚ÄúWe find that applying an imperceptible non-random perturbation to a test image, it is possible to arbitrarily Change the Network‚Äôs Prediction. ‚	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
Ä¶ We term the so perturbed examples ‚Äòadversarial examples‚Äô.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
‚Äù in work [1]. Many other works [2,3] follow this definition that adversarial examples are the ones misclassified by the network Ôºàby adding imperceptible perturbationsÔºâ.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, all works in adversarial attack community report the ‚Äúsuccess rate of attack‚Äù as the misclassification rate of their target model without checking whether the generated examples are reasonable to humans or not.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
As long as the prediction is different from the ground truth, the perturbed example is ‚Äúadversarial‚Äù no matter it is reasonable to human or not.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Second, we think there are two evaluations of ‚Äúthe impact of the adversarial attack‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
One is whether the error happens, it is evaluated by the success rate of attack (misclassification rate of the target model).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
The other is how long the error lasts, it is evaluated by the time that a human user detects the attack.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
LabelFool does as well as other attacks on the first evaluation, but does better on the second evaluation because it is less detectable by a human user.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10157
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Third, we only conduct experiments on the image classification task and you think this task is less likely to be ‚Äúinspected‚Äù by humans.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	10157
But the fact is, this task is widely used in many fields in our life.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10157
Please see Figure 9 in Appendix E in the new version.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10157
Taking face recognition system for entrance as an example, there will usually be a guard as ‚Äúa human inspector‚Äù to check whether the man A who is entering the gate is the same as the system shows.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10157
In this case, if a model just misclassifies A and C, the person who looks totally different from A, the attack will be detected easily.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10157
But LabelFool aims to let the model misclassify A and B who looks like A as shown in Figure 9.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10157
If the guard doesn‚Äôt identify carefully, he will let a fake B in and this error brings great potential security risks.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10157
So as an attacker, it is necessary to generate imperceptible examples in the label space for this task.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10157

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q: Which factors lead to NGDS being slower than PROSE on some tasks?	O	O	Reply	365
[line_break_token]Our method is slower than PROSE when the predictions do not satisfy the requirements of the controller i.e. all the predicted scores are within the threshold or they violate the actual scores in branch and bound exploration.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	365
This leads to NGDS evaluating the LSTM for branches that were previously pruned.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
This can be especially harmful when branches that got pruned out at the very beginning of the search need to be reconsidered -- as it could lead to evaluating the network many times.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
While evaluating the network leads to minor additions in run-time, there are many such additions, and since PROSE performance is already < 1s for such cases, this results in considerable relative slowdown.	O	O	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Why do the predictions violate the controller's requirements?	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	365
This happens when the neural network is either indecisive (its predicted scores for all branches are too close) or wrong (its predicted scores have exactly the opposite order of the actual program scores).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
[line_break_token]We will update the draft with this discussion and present some examples below[line_break_token][line_break_token]Some examples:[line_break_token]A) "41.711483001709,-91.4123382568359,41.6076278686523,-91.6373901367188"  ==>  "41.711483001709"[line_break_token][tab_token]The intended program is a simple substring extraction.	O	O	Reply	365
However, at depth 1, the predicted score of Concat is much higher than the predicted score of Atom, and thus we end up exploring only the Concat branch.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	365
The found Concat program is incorrect because it uses absolute position indexes and does not generalize to other similar extraction tasks with different floating-point values in the input strings.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365

It is difficult to conclude overall if the technique helps in synthesis.	I-Review	I-2	Review	365
> Q: Please clarify how the system is trained.	O	O	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) We use the industrially collected set of 375 string transformation tasks.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	365
Each task is a single input-output examples and 2-10 unseen inputs for evaluating generalization.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
Further, we split the 375 tasks into 65% train, 15% validation, and 20% test ones.	O	O	Reply	365
[line_break_token]2) We run PROSE on each of those tasks and collect the (symbol, production, spec input, spec output -> best program score after learning) information on all nodes of the search tree.	O	O	Reply	365
As mentioned in the introduction, such traces provide a rich description of the synthesis problem thanks to the Markovian nature of deductive search in PROSE and enabling the creation of large datasets required for learning deep models.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	365
As a result, we obtain a dataset of ~450,000 search outcomes from mere 375 tasks.	O	O	Reply	365
[line_break_token]3) We further split all the search outcomes by the used symbol or its depth in the grammar.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	365
In our final evaluation, we present the results for the models trained on the decisions on the `transform` (depth=1), `pp`, `pos` symbols.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
We have also trained other symbol models as well as a single common model for all symbols/depths, but they didn‚Äôt perform as well.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
[line_break_token]4) We employ Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) to optimize the objective.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
We use a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.01 and use early stopping to pick the final model.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365

We will add the specific training details in the next revision of the paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
[line_break_token]5) As discussed in Section 3.3, the learned models are integrated in the corresponding PROSE controller when the current search tree node matches the model's conditions (i.e. it is on the same respective symbol or depth).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]> Q: Is the approach useful for synthesis when there is a loss in program accuracy?	O	O	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In fact, NGDS achieves higher average test accuracy than baseline PROSE (68.49% vs. 67.12%), although with slightly lower validation accuracy (63.83% vs. 70.21%) which effectively corresponds to 4 tasks.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]However, this is not the most important factor: PBE is bound to often fail in synthesizing the _intended_ program from a single input-output example.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
Even a machine-learned ranking function picks the wrong program 20% of the time (Ellis & Gulwani, IJCAI 2017).	O	O	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Thus, the main goal of this work is speeding up the synthesis process on difficult scenarios without sacrificing the generalization accuracy too much.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	365
As a result, we achieve on average 50% faster synthesis time, with 10x speed-ups for many difficult tasks that require multiple seconds while still retaining competitive accuracy.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
Appendix C shows the breakdown of time and accuracy: out of 120 validation/test tasks, there are:[line_break_token]- 76 tasks where both systems are correct,[line_break_token]- 7 tasks where PROSE learns a correct program and NGDS learns a wrong one,[line_break_token]- 4 tasks where PROSE learns a wrong program and NGDS learns a correct one,[line_break_token]- 33 tasks where both systems are wrong	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365

The paper presents a branch-and-bound approach to learn good programs[line_break_token](consistent with data, expected to generalise well), where an LSTM is[line_break_token]used to predict which branches in the search tree should lead to good[line_break_token]programs (at the leaves of the search tree).	O	O	Review	365
The LSTM learns from[line_break_token]inputs of program spec + candidate branch (given by a grammar[line_break_token]production rule) and ouputs of quality scores for programms.	O	O	Review	365
The issue[line_break_token]of how greedy to be in this search is addressed.	O	O	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the authors' set up we simply assume we are given a 'ranking[line_break_token]function' h as an input (which we treat as black-box).	O	O	Review	365
In practice[line_break_token]this will simply be a guess (perhaps a good educated one) on which[line_break_token]programs will perform correctly on future data.	O	O	Review	365
As the authors[line_break_token]indicate, a more ambitious paper would consider learning h, rather[line_break_token]than assuming it as a given.	B-Review	B-2	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper has a number of positive features.	O	O	Review	365
It is clearly written[line_break_token](without typo or grammatical problems).	O	O	Review	365
The empirical evaluation[line_break_token]against PROSE is properly done and shows the presented method working[line_break_token]as hoped.	O	O	Review	365
This was a competent approach to an interesting (real)[line_break_token]problem.	O	O	Review	365
However, the 'deep learning' aspect of the paper is not[line_break_token]prominent: an LSTM is used as a plug-in and that is about it.	B-Review	B-1	Review	365
Also,[line_break_token]although the search method chosen was reasonable, the only real[line_break_token]innovation here is to use the LSTM to learn a search heuristic.	I-Review	I-1	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors do not explain what "without attention" means.	B-Review	B-3	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]I think the authors should mention the existence of (logic) program[line_break_token]synthesis using inductive logic programming.	B-Review	B-4	Review	365
There are also (closely[line_break_token]related) methods developed by the LOPSTR (logic-based program[line_break_token]synthesis and transformation) community.	I-Review	I-4	Review	365

Thank you for the related work suggestions -- we will update this discussion in the next draft.	O	O	Reply	365
We address your concerns below: [line_break_token][line_break_token]> Q: Limited innovation in terms of deep learning:[line_break_token][line_break_token]Rather than being a pure contribution to deep learning, this work applies deep learning to the important field of program synthesis, where statistical approaches are still underexplored.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	365
Our main contribution is a hybrid approach to program synthesis that utilizes the best of both neural and symbolic synthesis techniques.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
Combining insights from both worlds in this way achieves a new milestone in program synthesis performance: from a single example it generates programs that generalize better than prior state-of-the-art (including neural RobustFill, symbolic PROSE, and hybrid DeepCoder), the generated program is provably correct, and the generation is 50% faster on average[line_break_token][line_break_token]DeepCoder (Balog et al ICLR 2017) first explored a hybrid approach last year by first predicting the likelihood of various operators and then using it to guide an external symbolic synthesis engine.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
Since deep networks are data-hungry, Balog et al obtain training data by randomly sampling programs from the DSL and generating satisfying random strings as input-output examples.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
As noted in Section 1 and as evidenced by its inferior performance against our method, the generated programs tend to be unnatural leading to poor generalization.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
In contrast, NGDS closely integrates neural models at each step of the synthesis and so, it is possible to obtain large amounts of training data while utilizing a relatively small number of real-world examples.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]> Q: Learning the ranking function instead of taking it as a given: [line_break_token][line_break_token]While related, this problem is orthogonal to our work: a ranking function evaluates whether a given full program generalizes well, whereas we aim to predict the generalization of the best program produced from a given partial search state.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Importantly, the proposed technique, NGDS is independent of the ranking function and can be trivially integrated with any high-quality ranking function.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
For instance, the manually written ranking function of FlashFill in PROSE that we use is a result of 7 years of engineering and heavy fine-tuning for industrial applications.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
An even better-quality learned ranking function would only improve the accuracy of predictions, which are already on par with baseline PROSE (68.49% vs 67.12%).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In fact, a lot of recent prior work focuses on learning a ranking function for program induction, see (Singh & Gulwani, CAV 2015) and (Ellis & Gulwani, IJCAI 2017).	O	O	Reply	365
For comparison, we are currently performing a set of experiments with an ML-learned ranking function; we'll update with the new results once it's done.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]> Q: What does "without attention" mean?	O	O	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]All the models we explore encode input and output examples using (possibly multi-layered, bi-directional) LSTMs with or without an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al ICLR 2015).	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	365
As mentioned in Section 8, the most accurate predictions arise when we attend to the input string while encoding the output string similar to the attention-based models proposed by Devlin et al 2017.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
We will make this clearer in the next version of the paper.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Such an attention mechanism allows the network to learn complex features like "whether the output is a substring of the input".	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
Unfortunately, such accuracy comes at a cost of increasing the network evaluation time to quadratic instead of linear.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
As a result, prediction time at every node of the search tree dominates the search time, and NGDS is slower than PROSE even when its predictions are accurate.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
Therefore, we only use LSTM models without any attention mechanism in our evaluations.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365

The article "PairNorm: Tackling Oversmoothing in GNNs" considers the interesting phenomenon of performance degradation of graph neural network when the depth of the network increases beyond the values of 2-4.	O	O	Review	365
The authors argue that one of the reasons for such behavior is so-called "oversmoothing", when intermediate representations become similar for all the nodes in the graph.	O	O	Review	365
The authors propose the special NN layer "PairNorm", which aims to battle with this issue.	O	O	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The proposed PairNorm approach boils down to the recentering and normalization of all the representations after each graph-convolutional layer of the network.	O	O	Review	365

The one which makes the norms of all the representations equal to pre-specified constant, i.e. just projection of all the embeddings on the sphere.	O	O	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I should note that the two proposed approaches are very different in nature, though the latter one is introduced without much additional discussion.	O	O	Review	365
The benefits of approach 1 are not entirely clear as it basically just scales the whole embedding population.	B-Review	B-1	Review	365
Such a scaling doesn't affect the relative distances between points and thus should not have major effect on the performance.	I-Review	I-1	Review	365
Approach 2 is completely different due to the projection on the sphere of each embedding independently.	B-Review	B-2	Review	365
However, the reasons why it is a good idea or not are not discussed in the paper.	I-Review	I-2	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experimental part of the paper considers several standard graph data sets.	O	O	Review	365
The authors report that the proposed normalization schemes do not improve the quality of classification in the standard semi-supervised learning setting.	B-Review	B-3	Review	365
They additionally consider artificially created missing features and observe increasing quality in such a scenario.	B-Review	B-4	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To sum up, I think that while the motivation behind the paper is very natural, it doesn't look like the paper finds the solution both theoretically and experimentally.	B-Review	B-5	Review	365

We find that solving oversmoothing problem would not improve the performance of SSL on the standard benchmark datasets.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
The reasons are two-fold.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
First, the best performance of SSL on standard datasets is achieved within less than 3 layers, at which oversmoothing does not happen.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
Rather, we obtain a smoothing effect, which is in fact beneficial.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
In such cases, clearly PairNorm is not needed as it is designed to solve the oversmoothing issue for deep GNNs.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
Second, smoothing is the key effect of Graph Convolution to achieve good performance for SSL, as it improves the generalization ability of the model by reducing the gap between training loss and validation loss.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
This is clearly shown in Figure 1, where the gap between training loss and validation/test loss shrinks with increasing number of layers.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
Generalization ability is the most important factor for improving performance, and this is true particularly for SSL where we only have a very small training set, which makes the empirical risk not reliable for estimating true risk.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	365
Empirically, we often see the training loss for SSL goes to 0 easily while validation loss is still large. ‚	O	O	Reply	365

PairNorm is designed to solve oversmoothing, and SSNC-MF is such a problem where oversmoothing does happen as this scenarios necessitates training deep GNNs.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	365

Summary[line_break_token][line_break_token]It is known that GNNs are vulnerable to the oversmoothing problem, in which feature vectors on nodes get closer as we increase the number of (message passing type graph convolution layers).	O	O	Review	365
This paper proposed PairNorm, which is a normalization layer for GNNs to tackle this problem.	O	O	Review	365
The idea is to pull apart feature vectors on a pair of non-adjacent nodes (based on the interpretation of Laplace-type smoothing by NT and Maehara (2019)).	O	O	Review	365
To achieve this approximately with low computational complexity, PairNorm keeps the sum of distances of feature vectors on all node pairs approximately the same throughout layers.	O	O	Review	365
The paper conducted empirical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the method.	O	O	Review	365
PairNorm improved the prediction performance and enabled make GNNs deep, especially when feature vectors are missing in the large portion of nodes (the SSNC-MV problem).	O	O	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Decision[line_break_token][line_break_token]I want to recommend to accept the paper because, in my opinion, this paper contributes to deepening our understanding of graph NNs by giving new insights into what causes the oversmoothing problem and which types problem (deep) graph NNs can solve.	O	O	Review	365
[line_break_token]The common myth about graph NNs is that they cannot make themselves deep due to the oversmoothing.	O	O	Review	365

This paper found that the deep structures do help to improve (or at least worsen) the predictive performance when the significant portion of nodes in a graph does not have input signals.	O	O	Review	365
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that showed the effectiveness of deep structures in citation network datasets (Deep GCNs [Li et al 2019] successfully improved the prediction performance of (residual) graph NNs using as many as 56 layers for point cloud datasets).

Authors improve upon dynamic routing between capsules by removing the squash function (norm normalization) and apply a layerNorm normalization instead.	O	O	Review	365
Furthermore, they experiment with concurrent routing rather than sequential routing (route all caps layers once, then all layers concurrently again and again).	O	O	Review	365
This is an interesting development since provides better gradient in conjunction with layerNorm.	O	O	Review	365
They report results on Cifar10 and Cifar100 and achieve similar to CNN (resnet) performance.	O	O	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, I want to point out that inverted attention is exactly what happens in dynamic routing (sabour et al 2017), proc.	B-Review	B-1	Review	365
1 line 4,5, and 7.	I-Review	I-1	Review	365
In dynamic routing the dot product with the next layer capsule is calculated and then normalized over all next layer capsules.	I-Review	I-1	Review	365
The only difference that I notice between alg.	I-Review	I-1	Review	365

There is no "reconstructing the layer bellow" in Dynamic routing as authors suggest in intro.	I-Review	I-1	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Second, the Capsules are promised to have better viewpoint generalizability than CNNs while having comparable performance.	B-Review	B-2	Review	365
Replacing the 1 convolution layer with a ResNet backbone and replacing the activation with a classifier on top seems reducing the proposed CapsNet to the level of CNNs in terms of Viewpoint Generalization.	I-Review	I-2	Review	365
Why should someone use this network rather than the ResNet itself?	I-Review	I-2	Review	365
Fewer number of parameters by itself is not interesting, the reason it is reported usually is that it indicates lower memory consumption or fewer flops.	I-Review	I-2	Review	365
Is that the case when comparing the baseline ResNet with the proposed CapsNet?	I-Review	I-2	Review	365
Otherwise, a set of experiments showcasing the viewpoint generalizability of proposed CapsuleNetworks might only justify the switch between resnets to the proposed capsnets.	I-Review	I-2	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Thirdly, Fig.	B-Review	B-3	Review	365

In the text it is said that optimization hyperparameters are tuned individually.	I-Review	I-3	Review	365
Did authors tune learning rate schedule individually?	I-Review	I-3	Review	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Forth, the proper baseline for the current study is the dynamic routing CapsNet.	B-Review	B-4	Review	365
Why the multiMNIST experiment lacks comparison with dynamic routing capsnet?	I-Review	I-4	Review	365

 [line_break_token][line_break_token][Remarks on Inverted Dot-Product Attention Routing][line_break_token]We agree that our routing method has similar components to Dynamic Routing (Sabour et al 2017), and we would like to emphasize their differences : 1) Sequential iterative routing is replaced with concurrent iterative routing, 2) Squash activation is replaced with Layer Normalization, and 3) We use cross-entropy loss instead of margin loss.

in figure 4 it looks like the learning rate is decayed at two distinct points for your model, but only one distinct point for both the EM and Dynamic routing models.	I-Review	I-1	Review	365
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]-"Notably, the prediction becomes random guess when the iteration number increases to 5."	B-Review	B-2	Review	365
this sentence is a little confusing.	I-Review	I-2	Review	365
Do you mean when the iteration number the performance is equivalent to not random assignments?	I-Review	I-2	Review	365
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]- This new algorithm requires that the capsules in L+1 have initialized poses with which to compare agreement between the poses in L. This is initial value seems like it may greatly effect the performance of the model.	B-Review	B-3	Review	365

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The first reason is that we perform iterative routing, which means that we perform routing multiple times.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
Since CapsNet is a weight-tied architecture, the memory usage scales linearly with the number of iterations.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
The details can be found in the illustration in Figure 3 and the bar plot of memory usage in Figure 4.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
Note that this phenomenon is also observed in Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) [1]. Inspired by DEQs, a potential solution is to refer to a fixed-point optimization for finding equilibrium points of the routing updates.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
Then, we can enjoy the benefits of constant memory.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The second reason is that CapsNet uses the routing mechanism.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
As compared to the operations in CNNs, the routing mechanism performs agreement calculation between layers.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
This calculation introduces additional memory usage.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
However, we note that the routing mechanism is a dense operation, which means that we need to perform routing between all lower-layer capsules and all higher-layer capsules.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365
We can instead randomly sample the capsules for routing, making the routing mechanism a sparse operation.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	365

This paper's contribution is a method for automatically growing the depth of a neural network during training.	O	O	Review	20646
It compares several heuristics that may be used to successfully achieve this goal and identifies a set of choices that work well together on multiple datasets.	O	O	Review	20646
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper focuses on CNNs that conform to a popular design pattern where the network is organized into a series of sub-networks, each consisting of a series of sub-modules (sometimes called blocks) operating at the same resolution.	O	O	Review	20646
To be precise, the proposed method aims to learn the length of each series of sub-modules.	O	O	Review	20646
A main contribution of the paper is the demonstration that it is not necessary to train a network until convergence before adding new sub-modules as proposed in past work.	O	O	Review	20646
Instead, it is better to grow the network after training for a short while.	O	O	Review	20646
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My current decision for this paper is a weak rejection due to the points below.	O	O	Review	20646
However, I am open to revising my opinion if these points are addressed satisfactorily.	O	O	Review	20646
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The growing strategy identified in the paper as a superior alternative seems to be already known and used, at least in the speech recognition community.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20646
Seide et al (2011) called it Discriminative Pre-training, and showed that it outperforms greedy layer-wise pretraining and DBN pre-training.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20646
Zeyer et al (2017) reported that a similar method also enables the training of very deep LSTM networks which is otherwise notoriously hard.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20646
In general, the existence of prior work with the same ideas does not preclude acceptance, but the existence of this work needs to be clearly stated early on and the additional value of the current study sufficiently clarified.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20646
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- I find it strange that the final networks found by the proposed method usually have the same/similar number of sub-modules per sub-network (Tables 4,5,6) on multiple datasets.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20646
The only exceptions appear to be Basic4ResNet/CIFAR100 in Table 6 and about 50% of ImageNet results in Table 7.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20646
This regularity suggests that either A) the proposed algorithm prefers to set same number of sub-modules per sub-network due to its design, or B) datasets except ImageNet have an inherent shared property that produces this result.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20646
Since option A suggests a bias in the algorithm, this peculiarity of the results needs to be investigated or explained further.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20646
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Figure 3 constitutes the main evidence that Autogrow finds approximately optimal depths as compared to manual searching, but it is not clear how the plot for baselines is obtained.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20646
For any given parameter budget, there are multiple baseline networks possible since the sub-networks can have different number of sub-modules (see previous point).	I-Review	I-3	Review	20646
This does not appear to be accounted for in Figure 3.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20646
Further, when dealing with CNNs, it would be more useful to have computation budget on the x-axis instead of the parameter budget.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20646
This would better account for the difference between increasing depth in an earlier sub-network vs. a later one.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20646
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The reported results appear to be for single trials throughout the paper.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20646
This does not seem sufficient especially for results in Tables 2 and 3 where many differences are rather small, and so drawing conclusions from these tables would be unscientific.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20646

B-Review	B-1	Review	20646
As I mentioned earlier, a sufficient rewrite of the paper can clearly state what has been done already so as not to take credit from the earlier authors.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20646
A revised version of the paper has not been uploaded; I suggest that the authors do so for the future.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20646
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I agree that the focus of this paper is learning the 'optimal' depth by using the growing strategy.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20646
But I am not convinced that the technique indeed finds optimal depths based on the regularity of the sub-network depths mentioned in my review.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20646
The rebuttal suggests reasons for the obtained regularity, but does not prove that these regular structures obtained are indeed optimal and not an artifact of the algorithm itself.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20646
The baselines are also using the same regular architectures, which distorts the overall picture because it is possible that a non-regular architecture provides a better trade-off.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20646
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While my rating doesn't change, I do think that the work is in an interesting direction.	O	O	Review	20646

We quite appreciate similar discoveries of "(1) stopping very early by going through the data only once and (2) using large learning rate" in that paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20646

Contributions:[line_break_token][tab_token]This paper best fits in the literature that explores growing network depth.	O	O	Review	20646
 The main framework here is to interleave training a shallower network and adding new layers.	O	O	Review	20646
 This paper (their final algorithm) differs from existing methods in that they: 1) initialize the new layers using standard initialization as opposed to the commonly used zero-init in this literature, 2) grows at a fixed interval , and this interval is short (to avoid the shallower nets being  overly-trained).,	O	O	Review	20646
3) uses a large and constant learning rate during the growing phase.	O	O	Review	20646
 [line_break_token]Empirically, they show competitive results on standard image benchmarks.	O	O	Review	20646
 [line_break_token]More interestingly (to me), they provide interesting insights to this paradigm of ‚Äògrowing networks‚Äô.	O	O	Review	20646
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]Comments/Questions:[line_break_token]Section 2 of the paper describes the proposed method is good details.	O	O	Review	20646
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]Section 3 of the paper describes the experiments.	O	O	Review	20646
 Since for now I see the contribution of this paper is mostly empirical, I will give my detailed feedback here.	O	O	Review	20646
[line_break_token]3.1 (Suboptimum of Network Morphism (NM) )[line_break_token]Table 2 shows NM is worse than training from scratch, and this isn‚Äôt fixed by AdamInit.	O	O	Review	20646
[line_break_token]Table 3 shows c-AutoGrow (in between p-AutoGrow and NM) still does worse than from scratch, pinpoint the problem to converged subnetworks.	O	O	Review	20646
[line_break_token]3.2  (p-AutoGrow)[line_break_token]Table 3 shows +Constant LR helps, then +RandomInit helps.	O	O	Review	20646
[line_break_token]Table 4, 5 shows +Periodic gets the best performance.	O	O	Review	20646
 [line_break_token]*Suggestion* The found net is Table 4,5  are significantly deeper than those in Table 2,3, also there are no \Delta.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20646
 Also, although within this write-up those are the highest numbers, in the broader literature of NAS this doesn‚Äôt seem to be that good.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20646
 From a quick search, many methods in the Table 1 of [1] seems to give &gt;96% accuracy on CIFAR10, some even close to 98%.	O	O	Review	20646
 It might be good to at least discuss why this method is limited from achieving that.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20646
[line_break_token]I do like the finding that ZeroInit is unnecessary, as reported in the rest of this subsection.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20646
 However, it is unsatisfying to me that many past works (as cited by the authors) required this ZeroInit without ever trying RandomInit.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20646
 [line_break_token]*Suggestion* I would love to see a more thorough discussion on why GauInit is better than ZeroInit, not just more numbers.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20646
 For example, even just text description on why past works found ZeroInit useful, and countering some of those claims would be interesting.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20646
 A more controlled experiment rather than training 2 networks by swapping this would be interesting.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20646
 ZeroInit is used in more context than just NM.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20646
 For example, good flow models like Glow also uses such initialization, for likely a different reason, but I wonder if findings here have any implication for ZeroInit more generally.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20646
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.3 (Many datasets)[line_break_token]Table 6 is a strong result.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20646
 One odd thing is how deep the found-net has to be for MNIST.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20646
 This actually suggest to me that AutoGrow does not have the ability to stop early when it can.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20646
 And in the discussion, the authors argue that by using a better sub-module like in NAS they can do better.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20646
 This raises the question why the authors did not choose to use it.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20646
 I would believe it if the proposed method has obvious reasons that it can transfer to different architecture, but for now I cannot jump to the conclusion that, say, p-AutoGrow with GauInit will necessarily work when using a different sub-module.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20646
 Perhaps, the reason past NM works didn‚Äôt use a GauInit was also due to the fact that past sub-modules didn‚Äôt work with GauInit.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20646
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]3.4 (Scale to ImageNet) It‚Äôd be good to add reference results from other papers.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20646
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor details:[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]There are some good contents in this work, but for it to be a strong *empirical* contribution, perhaps it would be more useful to include experiments on other data modality where things are not so well tuned, and show state-of-the-art results.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20646
 For it to be a strong *analysis* paper, it should expanded, at least addressing some of the *suggestions* mentioned above.	I-Review	I-5	Review	20646

[line_break_token][line_break_token]*Suggestion* 2:[line_break_token]* In this paper, the major difference of applying ZeroInit is that we first train a shallower net to some extent (not fully converged) and then keep adding some new layers, which are initialized by ZeroInit; while previous literature just uses ZeroInit as parameter initialization and then train it without changing the neural architecture.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20646
The ZeroInit plays different roles:[line_break_token]** in previous literature, an intrinsic shallower net is not trained (not converged) at the beginning and, after just few iterations, the ZeroInit layers turn to non-zeros (random values) quickly, which is why those work well with ZeroInit.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20646
We argue that the previous work is more like a random initialization after training for a few iterations.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20646
[line_break_token]** in our literature, the shallower net is trained to some extent; using ZeroInit to initialize new layers will stick to local minimum.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20646

ICLR 201	O	O	Reply	820

This paper proposes to combine unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation with prototypical networks and finds that the proposed model performs well on few-shot learning task with domain shift, much better than other few-shot learning baselines that do not consider.	O	O	Review	820
Specifically it tests on Omniglot with natural image background and cliparts to real images.	O	O	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]It is true that current meta-learning approaches do not address the problem of domain shift, and as a result, the testing domain has to be the same with the training domain.	O	O	Review	820
However, this paper rather than proposing solution address the meta-learning problem, albeit the title ‚Äúmeta domain adaptation‚Äù, only brings few-shot learning to domain adaptation.	O	O	Review	820
Here‚Äôs why:[line_break_token][line_break_token]In order for a meta-learning model to be called ‚Äúmeta domain adaptation,‚Äù the type of adaptation cannot be seen during training, and the goal is to test on adaptation that the model has not seen before.	O	O	Review	820
Indeed, each task in meta domain adaptation should be seen as a pair of source task and target task.	O	O	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The problem with the current model is that during training, it is trained to target at one specific type of test domain--the generator network G aims to generated images that align with the unsupervised  test domain X_test.	B-Review	B-1	Review	820
Thus, the trained model will also only be able to handle one test domain, not much different than regular meta-learning models.	I-Review	I-1	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In short, the meta-learning part stays in the regular few-shot learning module (which is implemented as a prototypical network), and has nothing related to domain adaptation.	B-Review	B-2	Review	820
Therefore, the paper cannot be qualified for ``meta domain adaptation‚Äô‚Äô and has very limited novelty in terms of its contribution to meta-learning; however, the combination of domain adaptation and few-shot learning is fair.	I-Review	I-2	Review	820
For the rest of my review, I will treat the paper as ‚Äúfew-shot learning with domain adaptation‚Äù for more appropriate analysis.	I-Review	I-2	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For the experiments, there seems to have a great win of the proposed algorithm against the baselines.	B-Review	B-3	Review	820
However, I think since this is few-shot learning with domain adaptation, there is no domain adaptation baselines being mentioned in comparison.	I-Review	I-3	Review	820
Specifically, what if the few-shot learning component is removed, and the network is trained with standard domain adaptation.	I-Review	I-3	Review	820
Then use the same network to extract the features and then using the nearest neighbor to retrieve the classes.	I-Review	I-3	Review	820
Also it seems that the regular batch normalization could be very sensitive to domain shifts, and it would be good if the authors can test other normalization schemes such as layer/group normalization as baselines.	I-Review	I-3	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Another concern is that the evaluation of domain adaptation does not have much varieties.	B-Review	B-4	Review	820
Only two domains shifts are evaluated in the paper, specifically Omniglot + BSD500 and Office-Home.	I-Review	I-4	Review	820
BSD 500 only contains 500 images, and it would be good if more diverse set of images are considered.	I-Review	I-4	Review	820
Other domain transfer settings such as synthetic rendered vs. real (e.g. visDA challenge) could have been considered.	I-Review	I-4	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In conclusion, the paper presents a interesting combination of ProtoNet + Adversarial DA + Cycle consistency.	B-Review	B-5	Review	820
However, unlike as advertised, the paper does not address the domain shift issue in meta-learning, and the experiments lack thorough evaluation as the paper considers itself as a meta-learning paper and only compares to other meta-learning approaches without much comparison to domain adaptation papers.	I-Review	I-5	Review	820
Therefore, I recommend reject.	I-Review	I-5	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]---[line_break_token]Note: after reading the comments updated by authors, I remain my opinions: even though exact meta-testing data is unseen during training, the domain is seen during training, and therefore it cannot be qualified for being "meta domain adaptation".	O	O	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]===[line_break_token]After rebuttal:[line_break_token][line_break_token]I would like to thank the authors for the response and updating the draft.	O	O	Review	820
They have addressed 1) the title issue and 2) adding domain adaptation baselines.	O	O	Review	820
Considering these improvements, I would like to raise the score to 5, since the setting of combining few-shot learning and domain adaptation is interesting and the proposed model outperforms the baselines.	O	O	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]However, my criticisms remain that the paper is a simple combination of cycle GAN and prototypical networks, and lacks new insights/novelty.	B-Review	B-6	Review	820
The experiments use fairly small datasets, where the performance can be largely influenced by how good the feature extractor backbone is (e.g. training on more data and using deeper architecture would warrant better performance, and thus may change the conclusion).	B-Review	B-7	Review	820

[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]We appreciate the concern in the updated comments, but would like to point out that the novelty in our work should be viewed from two angles: the need to study this problem (i.e., the problem setting), and the proposed solution.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	820
We have identified a novel problem setting, which is closer to the real world setting, than what has been studied so far under the meta-learning paradigm.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	820
Existing solutions are not effective in this setting, restricting their use in the real world.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	820
Addressing this setting in our framework gives us a direction to improve the practical utility of meta-learning solutions for few-shot learning.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	820
Specifically, we identify that the principle of image-to-image translation is very suitable for this setting, and apply those concepts to boost the performance of few-shot learning under domain shift.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	820
As a combination of problem setting and proposed solution, we do believe we have addressed an important problem, and made a novel contribution.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As regards the experiments: ‚Äúfairly small datasets ‚Ä¶ feature extractor backbone‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]Most domain adaptation experiments use MNIST, USPS, SVHN, which are comparable in size to our Omniglot experiments.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	820
The other popular benchmark is using the Office-dataset, which also we have used (although a more recent version of a similar dataset, i.e., office-home ‚Äì more suitable for meta-learning evaluation, as it has larger number of classes).	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	820
See for example some of the recent domain adaptation papers [1, 2, 3]. [line_break_token][line_break_token]While a feature extractor backbone network may have some influence, we would like to highlight three points.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	820
First, when networks are trained in one domain, and evaluated in another, regardless of the backbone network, it is the domain-shift that dominates the performance.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	820
For example, no matter how large the network is, if it is trained to recognize black and white digits, it will still struggle to recognize colored digits.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	820
Second, any benefit of a larger backbone network will likely also enhance the performance of our model.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	820
Third, we just wanted to clarify (if there was a misunderstanding), unlike domain adaptation papers, we do not use a pretrained network ‚Äì we train the full network from scratch (following traditional meta-training settings).	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	820

ICML 201	O	O	Reply	820

The authors consider the few-shot / meta-learning scenario in which the test set of interest is drawn from a different distribution from the training set.	O	O	Review	820
This scenario is well-motivated by the "researcher example" given throughout the paper.	O	O	Review	820
The authors assume access to a large unlabelled set in test (target) domain, and a large labelled (few-shot) set in the source domain.	O	O	Review	820
Thus, the paper is concerned with unsupervised version of the meta-learning problem under domain shift (i.e., a large amount of data unlabelled are available from the target domain).	O	O	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The key idea is to learn a mapping from the source domain to the target domain.	O	O	Review	820
This mapping is learned jointly with the meta-learner, who performs the meta-learning in the target domain, on examples from the labelled domain.	O	O	Review	820
In practice however, it appears from the experimental section that the domain mapping is learned offline, and then frozen for the meta-learning phase.	O	O	Review	820
 Thus, at test time, given examples from the target domain, the meta-learner can perform few-shot learning.	O	O	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros:[line_break_token]- The paper addresses an important scenario which has not been addressed to this point: namely, meta-learning without the assumption that the train and test sets are drawn from the same domain/distribution.	O	O	Review	820
[line_break_token]- The authors propose a novel task and experimental framework for considering their method, and show (somewhat unsurprisingly) that their method outperforms standard meta-learning methods that do not properly account for domain shift.	O	O	Review	820
[line_break_token]- The paper reads well and is easy to follow.	O	O	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons:[line_break_token]- My main concern is reproducibility: the authors employ a number of large architectures, complex loss functions, and regularizers / "additional improvements".	B-Review	B-1	Review	820
Further, there a number of experimental details that need to be further elaborated upon.	I-Review	I-1	Review	820
e.g., architectures and hyper-parameters used, and training procedures (I encourage the authors to utilize the appendices for this).	I-Review	I-1	Review	820
It is unclear to me how difficult/easy these results would be to reproduce.	I-Review	I-1	Review	820
Do the authors intend to release code for their implementations and experiments?	I-Review	I-1	Review	820
[line_break_token]- Some assumptions are not explicitly stated.	B-Review	B-2	Review	820
In particular, it is unclear what the assumption on the size of the unlabelled test set is.	I-Review	I-2	Review	820
This is also lacking from the description of the experimental protocol, which does not address the data-splits (how many classes were used for each) and size of the unlabelled test set.	I-Review	I-2	Review	820
[line_break_token]- While the method is presented as jointly learning all the components, in the experimental section it is stated that the embedding network (the meta-learner) and the GAN-based domain adaptation are done separately.	B-Review	B-3	Review	820
Can the authors comment on this further?	I-Review	I-3	Review	820
Is this different from first learning a image translation mapping (using the unlabelled data in the target domain), and then applying existing meta-learning models/algorithms to the labelled data in the target domain?	I-Review	I-3	Review	820
[line_break_token]- The overall method seems to be not very principled, and requires a lot of "tweaks and tunes", with additional losses and regularizers, to work.	B-Review	B-4	Review	820
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, the paper proposes a method combining a number of existing useful works (prototypical networks for meta-learning and image-to-image translation for domain adaptation) to tackle an important problem setting that is not currently addressed in existing meta-learning research.	O	O	Review	820
Further, it establishes a useful experimental benchmark for this task, and provides what appear to be reasonable results (though this is somewhat difficult to judge due to the lack of baseline approaches).	O	O	Review	820
Hopefully, such a benchmark will inspire more researchers to explore this setting, and perhaps propose simpler, more principled approaches to perform this task.	O	O	Review	820
It is my impression that, if the authors elaborate on the experimental protocol and implementation details, this paper would be a good fit for the venue.	O	O	Review	820

This paper proposes a differentially private version of the lottery ticket mechanism using the exponential mechanism, thus improving the utility of DPSGD by reducing the number of parameters.	O	O	Review	20140

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The proposed algorithm seems quite interesting.	O	O	Review	20140
Though it is more of a simple combination of the non-private lottery ticket mechanism and the exponential mechanism, improving utility for DPSGD is a very important topic in differentially private machine learning.	O	O	Review	20140

[line_break_token][line_break_token]My only concern is on the aspect of privacy, specially Lemma 1.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20140
I think if you‚Äôre only using the fact that A and C are in [0, 1], then A*(1-nu*C) can change by 1 if you go from (A=0, C=0) to (A=1, C=0).	I-Review	I-1	Review	20140
In the last step of equation (5), you replaced A-A‚Äô by 1, which I think needs to be double-checked since there is the absolute value outside (and I guess the equality should  be &lt;=).	O	O	Review	20140
[line_break_token]If the calculation is correct, I‚Äôm still a bit concerned that the sensitivity is a bit too high compared to the signal.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20140
A and C are in [0, 1], and it seems like the sensitivity may not be much smaller than 1, which means the exponential mechanism can be pretty random.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20140
To that end, I think you may consider experimentally comparing with DPSGD with a randomly selected ticket, or a ticket with a moderate number of parameters kept.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]----- Post-rebuttal response -----[line_break_token]I still don't see why the sensitivity is |1-\nu|. (Doesn't that mean sensitivity is 0 when \nu=1?)	I-Review	I-1	Review	20140
If we have (A=1, C=0) and (A'=0, C'=0), we have S(A,C)-S(A',C')=1-0=1; if we have (A=1, C=0) and (A'=1, C'=1), we have S(A,C)-S(A',C')=1-(1-\nu)=\nu.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20140
Yet for \nu&lt;1, |1-\nu|&lt;1 and for \nu&gt;1, |\nu-1|&lt;\nu.	O	O	Review	20140
I believe the sensitivity should be something like max(\nu, 1).	B-Review	B-1	Review	20140
You may want to further check that.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20140
And I still think this is because the last step in (5) is not correct.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20140
Since you have absolute sign, you can't do |A-A'-X| \leq ||A-A'|-X|.[line_break_token][line_break_token]I'm also confused by the range of \nu I should think of.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20140
[line_break_token]If \nu &lt;= 1, then in the example you give (A = 0.8, C=0.9,0.7,0.4,0.1, eps=0.1), I think the probability distribution used by exponential mechanism is not much higher for 0.9 than 0.1 (I think it's roughly 0.22 vs. 0.29?)	O	O	Review	20140
with sensitivity |1-\nu|.[line_break_token]If \nu &gt; 1, then I don't quite understand the score function S(A,C) = A*(1-\nu*C), since for C &gt; 1/\nu, (1-\nu*C) is negative and S would thus penalize higher A. The higher \nu is, the wider the range of C that S will penalize.	O	O	Review	20140
I can sort of understand this as setting a threshold such that any C above that threshold is just considered useless, but I still think it's a bit unreasonable to penalize higher accuracy, even for very complex model.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20140

The existing differentially private training mechanism of deep neural networks includes a step that applies L2 normalization to gradient vectors.	O	O	Review	20140
The authors argued that such norm clipping could lead to a small norm model parameter at the end, and the noise can thus overwhelm the accumulated gradient, leading to a substantial loss in terms of utility.	O	O	Review	20140
To mitigate such utility loss, the authors proposed to use the lottery ticket mechanism to train a smaller network with similar utility and design an end-to-end differentially private mechanism for the whole process, including the selection of sub-network and the re-training of the selected sub-network.

The general idea is quite interesting, but I have the following concerns.	O	O	Review	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-   From Algorithm 1 of Abadi et al 2016, one could see that the norm of per instance gradient is at least C, and the added noise has standard deviation of \sigma C. Furthermore, since the final gradient step is an accumulation of all the per instance gradient in the mini-batch, this means that the scale of the final gradient is roughly, where is the batch size.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20140
Note that since the noise is added to the accumulation gradient, so the scale of the noise should be roughly 1/B of the accumulated gradient.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20140
It seems to me that in this case the injected noise shouldn't overwhelm the gradient vector.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20140
Could the authors have a comment on this?	I-Review	I-1	Review	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-   The overall algorithm can be understood as a simple composition of the Exponential Mechanism algorithm and the DPSGD algorithm.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20140
Both of them satisfy differential privacy, so by a simple composition theorem argument the whole process also satisfies DP.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20140
This all makes sense, but the novelty is quite limited.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20140
The authors claim that the proposed mechanism is [line_break_token]"different from DPSGD's naive implementation".	I-Review	I-2	Review	20140
This is not true, since at the end the original DPSGD algorithm is still used, just on a subnetwork.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-   If the goal is to train a model with fewer parameters and comparable utility, why not simply starting from a small model with DPSGD and then use the large model as a teaching model?	B-Review	B-3	Review	20140
This simple strategy naturally gives DP guarantee without worrying about the LTH, hence you can also get same privacy guarantee with less injected noise.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-   The experimental results basically confirm the expectation that with less injected noise, the model achieves better utility as compared with the DPSGD applied on the original large model.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20140
e thank the reviewer for their time and comments, and for appreciating the importance of our work.	O	O	Reply	20140
We provide our answers next.	O	O	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q1)  From Algorithm 1 of Abadi et al 2016, one could see that the norm of per instance gradient is at least C, and the added noise has standard deviation of \sigma C....[line_break_token][line_break_token]A1) Yes, in Abadi et al‚Äôs [1] Algorithm 1, we know that the norm of the per-observation gradient is bounded by, which enforces the sensitivity required for differential privacy.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20140
However, as the reviewer has mentioned, the noise reduction (in Algorithm 1 of [1]) depends on the group size (minibatch) (i.e. large group size provides a ‚Äúnoise reduction‚Äù effect), but at the same time, large group size also directly adversely impacts the noise scale ), see Theorem 1 of [1], where has a scaling effect on, where we get a smaller with smaller group size and vice-versa, this makes the naive DPSGD perform particularly worse on ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù datasets, see the performance gap for dataset ISOLET and HAR as an example (Figure 1 of our paper).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This phenomenon creates an interesting dilemma, where increasing batch size provides a "noise reduction" effect due to summation in Algorithm 1 [1], but at the same time increases the noise scale (Theorem 1 [1]).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20140
Abadi et al in the paper recommend using a smaller batch size for the same reason.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20140
In our case, as we are working with a very small fraction of model parameters compared to the full model, our method enjoys significantly better utility while simultaneously providing tight privacy.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20140
We have added this detail to our main comparison (Section 4.3).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Q2) The overall algorithm can be understood as a simple composition of the Exponential Mechanism algorithm and the DPSGD algorithm.....[line_break_token][line_break_token]A2) We consider DPSGD as a generic training algorithm, which has been used widely across models (such as differentially private GANs [2][3], adversarial examples [4], various versions of differentially private neural networks [5], etc.).	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20140
Our contribution is not based on the argument that we propose a radical new paradigm, but it is that we show how to significantly improve the existing method, which has direct implications on a wide array of methods using the naive method.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20140
We endeavored to make the algorithm and the paper as clear and as simple as possible, to ensure that it is easily accessible and applicable by a wide variety of practitioners, with a goal to boost the privacy-preserving machine learning in practice, prior successes of which have been limited, mainly due to the privacy-utility trade-offs of the current methods (which we propose to significantly improve upon).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Q3)  If the goal is to train a model with fewer parameters and comparable utility, why not simply starting from a small model with DPSGD and then use the large model as a teaching model? ....	O	O	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A3) There are several issues with this approach.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20140
First, starting from a random small model does not guarantee that the small model will provide good utility.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20140
This was the driving force behind the lottery ticket hypothesis (to find small, high utility models that can be trained from scratch in isolation).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20140
Second, when we move to the student-teacher paradigm, it is a different research direction, not our focus in this work, we propose methods to significantly improve the performance of DPSGD, without constraining the training setup, so that our approach can be used anywhere, where DPSGD is applicable.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token] Further, the student-teacher methods explored in previous models such as PATE [6] have their limitations.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20140
Such as the utility in PATE depends on the number of disjoint partitions, and the availability of public data to start the training process.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20140
This does not work in settings where we only have private sensitive data (in most scenarios requiring privacy protection), and in scenarios where the datasets are small (creating many disjoint partitions is not feasible).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20140
Our proposed method does not have any such limitations.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20140

This paper is a mash-up of recent work on differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) and the lottery ticket hypothesis.	O	O	Review	20140
Differential privacy is a paradigm for ensuring that statistical models learned from a large dataset do not disclose any particulars of individual elements of that dataset.	O	O	Review	20140
DPSGD is a technique that applies differential privacy ideas to models trained with stochastic gradient descent, where privacy is guaranteed by clipping and adding noise to gradients.	O	O	Review	20140
On the other hand, the lottery ticket hypothesis is a method for finding sparse sub-networks contained in larger dense neural network models that are at least as accurate as the underlying dense model.	O	O	Review	20140
The authors propose and demonstrate that by combining DPSGD with the lottery ticket hypothesis that they can train end-to-end differentially private models that outperform the DPSGD technique.	O	O	Review	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I am up in the air about whether or not to accept this paper.	O	O	Review	20140
I have trouble assessing the originality and significance of this work, the former since it seems to be a simple combination of two recent ideas, and the latter because I don't really have a context for how important the development of differentially-private optimization strategies are.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20140
I also didn't really find the experimental results to be that extensive, but I don't have a real sense of what state of the art is for differential privacy.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20140
Perhaps some of these issues could be mitigated by some additional exposition?	I-Review	I-4	Review	20140
I think one of my problems is that most of the paper is written to show that this new technique is superior to DPSGD, but I don't really have a good sense if either of them are sufficient as a practical solution of this problem.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Some additional questions I had are as follows:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) One of the reasons given for combining the lottery ticket hypothesis with DPSGD is that DPSGD scales poorly as models get larger due to clipping by the norm of the gradient.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20140
Could you not compensate for this by scaling the norm by the number of parameters, or does that mess up the differential-privacy calculation?	I-Review	I-1	Review	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) I don't understand how the winning ticket selection portion is differentially privacy.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20140
I understand that they use the exponential mechanism, but I would have assumed that the dataset needs to be varied in addition to the model.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20140
Is there an intuitive explanation for how privacy is achieved essentially just by varying the initialization and not actually adding noise to the data?	I-Review	I-2	Review	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) Are there any datasets or methods where the effectiveness of the differential privacy technique could be directly assessed?	B-Review	B-3	Review	20140
For example, is there a way of testing whether the model is memorizing specific data elements, and then further showing that these differential privacy techniques mitigate this?	I-Review	I-3	Review	20140
This would be a nice check to have in addition to the plots of accuracy vs. privacy budget.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20140
e thank the reviewer for their time and we sincerely hope we can clarify all doubts and provide clear answers to all questions.	O	O	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To start, we would like to emphasize the significance of our work, our work is more than a mere mash-up of recent works.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	20140
Our contribution lies in developing an end-to-end differentially private training paradigm for neural networks, which significantly improves upon the current state-of-the-art, both in terms of utility and privacy, using a fraction of the parameters of the full model.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20140
One of the main goals and a core research area in differentially private machine learning is to investigate and improve the privacy-utility trade-off.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20140
Our method, being accessible and providing significantly better utility with tight privacy guarantees aims to boost the real-world applicability of differentially private machine learning methods, which to date has enjoyed limited success, mainly due to the problems with limited utility.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Next, we provide answers to the specific questions raised by the respected reviewer.	O	O	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q1) One of the reasons given for combining the lottery ticket hypothesis with DPSGD is that DPSGD scales poorly as models get larger due to clipping by the norm of the gradient.	O	O	Reply	20140
Could you not compensate for this by scaling the norm by the number of parameters, or does that mess up the differential-privacy calculation?	O	O	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A1) Differential privacy guarantees in DPSGD [1] are based on bounding the impact of per-observation gradient via gradient clipping using the l2 norm, scaled by a constant, which then has a multiplicative effect on total noise ).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20140
Using a larger scaling parameter will directly lead to larger noise, thus diminishing utility.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Q2) I don't understand how the winning ticket selection portion is differentially privacy.	O	O	Reply	20140
I understand that they use the exponential mechanism, but I would have assumed that the dataset needs to be varied in addition to the model.	O	O	Reply	20140
Is there an intuitive explanation for how privacy is achieved essentially just by varying the initialization and not actually adding noise to the data?	O	O	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A2) We would like to emphasize that this step is just selecting the winning architecture, that is then trained with differential privacy from scratch.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20140
To ensure that the selection of the architecture is done in a differentially private fashion, we use the exponential mechanism with our custom score function.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20140
The exponential mechanism selects the winner with probability defined by the score function, in which the design of our custom score function ensures that we select "good" candidates with high probability.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20140
Simply put, the exponential mechanism selects the winners with "noisy" probability, not a "noisy winner" [2]. This is the part of the appeal of using the exponential mechanism, leading to its applicability in problems such as selecting max, top-k items, etc.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20140
with differential privacy.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Q3) Are there any datasets or methods where the effectiveness of the differential privacy technique could be directly assessed?	O	O	Reply	20140
For example, is there a way of testing whether the model is memorizing specific data elements, and then further showing that these differential privacy techniques mitigate this?	O	O	Reply	20140
This would be a nice check to have in addition to the plots of accuracy vs. privacy budget.	O	O	Reply	20140
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A3) There are some proposed methods such as the membership inference attack [3], that have been studied with DPSGD [4] and that have shown that DPSGD does indeed offer privacy protection to the contributing users in the training dataset, when the privacy guarantees are tight (small), but this also leads to the utility degradation, result of the privacy-utility trade-off, which our proposed method significantly improves upon.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20140
As our final winning ticket trains using the DPSGD method, we do not find it is necessary to evaluate the models against such attacks, especially when the results are already readily available.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20140
Instead, we focus on investigating and providing details on the significantly improved utility compared to the naive DPSGD.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20140

The authors present an online learning method for learning the structure of sum-product networks.	O	O	Review	382
The algorithm assumes Gaussian coordinate-wise marginal distributions, and learns both parameters and structure online.	O	O	Review	382
The parameters are updated by a recursive procedure that reweights nodes in the network that most contribute to the likelihood of the current data point.	O	O	Review	382
The structure learning is done by either merging independent product Gaussian nodes into multivariate leaf nodes, or creating a mixture over the two nodes when the multivariate would be too large.	O	O	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The fact that the dataset is scaled to some larger datasets (in terms of the number of datapoints) is promising, although the number of variables is still quite small.	O	O	Review	382
Current benchmarks for tractable continuous density modeling with neural networks include the NICE and Real-NVP families of models, which can be scaled to both large numbers of datapoints and variables.	O	O	Review	382
Intractable methods like GAN, GenMMN, VAE have the same property.	O	O	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The main issue with this work for the ICLR audience is the use of mainly a set of SPN-specific datasets that are not used in the deep learning generative modeling literature.	B-Review	B-1	Review	382
The use of GenMMN as a baseline is also not a good choice to bridge the gap to the neural community, as its Parzen-window based likelihood evaluation is not really meaningful.	I-Review	I-1	Review	382
Better ways to evaluate the likelihood through annealed importance sampling are discussed in "On the Quantitative Analysis of Decoder-Based Generative Models" by Wu et al I would recommend the use of a simple VAE type model to get a lower bound on the likelihood, or something like Real-NVP.	I-Review	I-1	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Most neural network density models are scalable to large numbers of observations as well as instances, and it is not clear that this method scales well "horizontally" like this.	B-Review	B-2	Review	382
Evaluating the feasibility of modeling something like MNIST would be interesting.	I-Review	I-2	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]SPNs have the strength that not only marginal but also various type of conditional queries are tractable, but performance on this is not evaluated or compared.	B-Review	B-3	Review	382
One interesting application could be in imputation of unknown pixels or color channels in images, for which there is not currently a high-performing tractable model.	I-Review	I-3	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Despite the disconnect from other ICLR generative modeling literature, the algorithm here seems simple and intuitive and convincingly works better than the previous state of the art for online SPN structure learning.	B-Review	B-4	Review	382
I think VAE is a much better baseline for continuous data than GenMMN when attempting to compare to neural network approaches.	I-Review	I-4	Review	382
Further, the sum-product network could actually be combined with such deep latent variable models as an observation model or posterior, which could be a very powerful combination.	I-Review	I-4	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I would like it if these SPN models were better known by the ICLR probabilistic modeling community, but I do not know if this paper does enough to make them relevant.	O	O	Review	382
As with the other reviewers, I am not an expert on SPNs.	O	O	Review	382
However, this seems to be a simple and effective algorithm for online structure induction, and the scalability aspect is something that is important in much recent work in the learning of representations.	O	O	Review	382
I think it is good enough for publication, although I would prefer to see many of the above additions to more clearly bridge the gap with other literature in deep generative modeling.	O	O	Review	382

 However, it is important to not loose track of the main contribution of the paper: an online structure learning algorithm for SPNs with Gaussian leaves.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	382
By comparing SPNs to other generative models, we are not comparing different structure learning techniques, but simply different models.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	382
 In fact, no structure learning technique has been proposed for generative models other than SPNs (as far as we know).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	382
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]We also not the insistence on scalability with respect to the number of features.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	382
 As mentioned above, oSLRAU scales quadratically with respect to the number of features.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	382
 While this does not permit to scale to large images with many pixels, please remember that this is the first online structure learning technique for SPNs with Gaussian leaves while other types of networks do not have any online structure learning technique.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	382
A fair comparison would be to compare the scalablity of parameter learning techniques for different types of neural nets.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	382

The authors contribute an algorithm for building sum-product networks (SPNs) from data, assuming a Gaussian distribution for all dimensions of the observed data.	O	O	Review	382
 Due to the restricted structure of the SPN architecture, building a valid architecture that is tailored to a specific dataset is not an obvious exercise, and so structure-learning algorithms are employed.	O	O	Review	382
 For Gaussian distributed observations, the authors state that the previous state of the art is to chose a random SPN that satisfies the completeness and decomposibility constraints that SPNs must observe, and to then learn the parameters (as done in Jaini 2016).	O	O	Review	382
 In the contributed manuscript, the algorithm begins with a completely factorized model, and then by passing through the data, builds up more structure, while updating appropriate node statistics to maintain the validity of the SPN.	O	O	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The above Jaini reference figures heavily into the reading of the paper because it is (to my limited knowledge) the previous work SOTA on SPNs applied to Gaussian distributed data, and also because the authors of the current manuscript compare performance to datasets studied in Jaini et al  I personally was unfamiliar with most of these datasets, and so have no basis to judge loglikelihoods, given a particular model, as being either good or poor.	B-Review	B-2	Review	382
 Nevertheless, the current manuscript reports results on these datasets that better (5 / 7) than other methods, such as SPNS (constructed randomly), Stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines or Generative Moment Matching networks.	I-Review	I-2	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall: [line_break_token]First let me say, I am not really qualified to make a decision on the acceptance or rejection of this manuscript (yet I am forced to make just such a choice) because I am not an expert in SPNs.	O	O	Review	382
I was also unfamiliar with the datasets, so I had no intuitive understanding of the algorithms performance, even when viewed as a black-box.	O	O	Review	382
 The algorithm is presented without theoretical inspiration or justification.	B-Review	B-1	Review	382
 These latter are by no means a bad thing, but it again gives me little hold onto when evaluating the manuscript.	I-Review	I-1	Review	382
 The manuscript is clearly written, and to my limited knowledge novel, and their algorithm does a good job (5/7) on selected datasets.	O	O	Review	382
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]My overall impression is that there isn't very much work here (e.g., much of the text is similar to Jaini, and most of the other experiments are repeated verbatim from Jaini), but again I may be missing something (this manuscript DOES mostly Jaini).

This paper introduces an encoder-decoder as a differentiable loss function for sequential autoregressive generation tasks and more specifically for summarization.	O	O	Review	382

[line_break_token][line_break_token]I see a fundamental issue with this work:[line_break_token][line_break_token]* During inference, authors decode from the probability distribution of the seq2seq model using beam search.	O	O	Review	382
[line_break_token]* But for training (original seq2seq + recorder) authors backpropagate the NLL loss (which is fully differentiable) of the recorder on reference summaries through the softmax probabilities of outputs from the seq2seq model.	B-Review	B-1	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]&gt;&gt; This whole architecture can be seen as a traditional end-to-end seq2seq model with non-linearity and normalization (softmax) in the middle.	O	O	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Additionally: [line_break_token]&gt;&gt; "backpropagating through the softmax weights during training and using the argmax during inference" falls into a long line of work for propagating non-differential objective functions through continuous relaxations [line_break_token] of categorical latent variables, more specifically the "straight through"  and "gumbel-softmax" (see refs.)

I believe there is a core misunderstanding in how the recoder helps train the summarizer, so let me clarify.	O	O	Reply	382
The key contribution is the recoder as a *loss function* for the summarizer's beam decoded outputs.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	382
What you referred to:[line_break_token][line_break_token]&gt; "backpropagating through the softmax weights during training and using the argmax during inference"[line_break_token][line_break_token]is to help train the summarizer through beam search decoding, which is not an element of our work.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	382
The recoder helps train the summarizer only by exposing it to its own output (y1...yt-1), without backpropagation to previous timesteps through beam search decoding.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	382
We tried to make this subtle point clear in Section 3.1, where we said "propagating errors to P_t improves the summarizer via exposure to what it would see at test time, even if the summarizer is not 'aware' of the search mechanism and cannot optimize for it".	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Propagating through beam search decoding would be accomplished by techniques such as Straight Through Gumbel-Softmax that you cited, or such as Goyal et al (2017) that we cited.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	382
These would be complementary additions to the recoder, as discussed in Section 4.2.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	382
We also discussed how our work differs from approaches such as reinforcement learning in Section 4.1.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	382
Other models that re-encode their output are discussed in Section 4.3.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The MeanSum work you cited is a related work in a different problem space; thanks for this reference.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	382
They also use the idea of re-encoding an output summary, but they differ in that their loss function l_sim is based on cosine distance in the hidden space, in contrast with our recoder loss J^R. Their "reconstruction cycle loss" variant is closer to our work, except they reconstruct the original reviews, which would be analogous in our problem to training the recoder to output the original article instead of the reference summary.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	382
We decided against doing this because in general the summary is a lossy representation of the original (mentioned in Section 4.3), an incongruence MeanSum also mentioned as a shortcoming.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	382

This paper proposed an encoder-decoder-based summarization network as a loss function within a similar encoder-decoder-based summarization framework to demonstrate that the proposed model obtains better automatic and human evaluation scores compared to the baseline model of See et al (2017) with just traditional loss functions.

This paper proposes to use an additional component to the commonly used encoder-decoder approach for summarization, which is referred to as the recoder, which is an RNN-syle component that takes the output of the decoder.	O	O	Review	382
The intuition offered in the paper is that a good summary should produce itself via the recoder network, and in training it together with the original encoder-decoder it should improve its performance as it would be able to capture more than what the word-level loss does.	O	O	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I have the following objections to this paper:[line_break_token]- I can't see why this extra component should improve the quality of the summary produced.	B-Review	B-1	Review	382
If say our encoder-decoder architecture models the training data perfectly, then a recoder that does not do anything would be the right choice.	I-Review	I-1	Review	382
Taking this further, a recoder could actually be fixing problems in the output of the decoder, and thus not providing a good training signal.	I-Review	I-1	Review	382
It doesn't make sense to my that a summary should produce itself via a neural network, unless we are training an auto-encoder.	I-Review	I-1	Review	382
The experiments validate this; the difference in ROUGE score are less than a point, which is the kind of fluctuation one expects due to random seed differences, etc.	I-Review	I-1	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- I find it odd that ROUGE score is dismissed as a loss to train against (referred to as a heuristic in the end of section 4.1), but then 1 ROUGE point difference is considered a "significant" improvement (making such claims without statistical significance testing is misleading).	B-Review	B-2	Review	382
Sure it has flaws, if there is something better why not use it for evaluation?	I-Review	I-2	Review	382
Furthermore, claiming that the recoder does a better job requires evidence.	I-Review	I-2	Review	382
Why not train this extra function against human judgements?	I-Review	I-2	Review	382
Assuming that what is wanted is to train a model that estimates the quality of the summary, it would make sense to look at the approaches used for the similar task of machine translation quality estimation: <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/tacl_a_00056" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/tacl_a_00056</a>[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The approach is in my view a kind of actor-critic approach; the recoder could play that role, and in fact the Bahdanau et al 2016 paper cited does this.	B-Review	B-3	Review	382
However no comparison is offered, be it theoretical or experimental.	I-Review	I-3	Review	382
Furthermore, the criticism that sequence-level training requires differentiable losses is incorrect; MIXER for example does train against scores such as ROUGE that are not differentiable.	I-Review	I-3	Review	382
Furthermore, the BSO approach by Wiseman and Rush (2016) cited does give a continuous output to optimize for seq2seq that is asked for in the beginning of page 4.	I-Review	I-3	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- In the experiments, how was the length penalty determined to be the graduated curve mentioned in section 5?	B-Review	B-4	Review	382
I would expect to have comparison against other approaches that try to train encoder-decoder to improve summarization, such as those mentioned in section 4.1.	I-Review	I-4	Review	382
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- On the human evaluation experiments: the difference between the two models is quite small, especially given that the workers were not allowed to say that the models were equally good/bad.	I-Review	I-4	Review	382
Furthermore, there is no inter-annotator agreement, as each comparison was done by a single crowd worker.	I-Review	I-4	Review	382
Showing only the first 400 tokens of the original document would incorrectly disadvantage models selecting content from later in the articles.	I-Review	I-4	Review	382
Finally, showing the reference summary creates another bias, since equally good summaries can disagree on what content to include.	I-Review	I-4	Review	382
It might be helpful to look at some recent work on manual evaluation of summarization that tried to address these issues: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01361" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01361</a>[line_break_token][line_break_token]	O	O	Review	382

Each number corresponds to a ratio of the total number of correctly classified pixels as a particular class, on the number of pixels belonging to this class in the dataset.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	7
[line_break_token]For the pixel-wise accuracy, we now give the standard deviation in Table 1, as well as the median.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	7
As the two variances are equal using depth or not, we computed the statistical significance using a two sample t-test, that results in a t statistic equal to 1.54, which is far from the mean performance of 52.2 and thus we can consider that the two reported means are statistically significant.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	7
[line_break_token][line_break_token]About the class-by class improvements displayed in Table 1, we discuss the fact that objects having a constant appearance of depth are in general more inclined to take benefit from depth information.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	7
As the major part of the scenes contains categories that respect this property, the improvements achieved using depth involve a smaller number of categories, but a larger volume of data.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	7

This work applies convolutional neural networks to the task of RGB-D indoor scene segmentation.	O	O	Review	7

Similarly to us, they apply the idea of using a kind of multi-scale network.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	7
However, Ciseran's approach to foveation differs from ours: where we use a multiscale pyramid to provide a foveated input to the network, they artificially blur the input's content, radially, and use non-uniform sampling to connect the network to it.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	7
The major advantage of using a pyramid is that the whole pyramid can be applied convolutionally, to larger input sizes.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	7
Once the model is trained, it must be applied as a sliding window to classify each pixel in the input.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	7

The paper investigates methods to train neural networks so the final network has sparse weights, both in convolutional layers and in fully connected layers.	O	O	Review	20401
In particular, the paper focuses on modifying the training so that the network is first trained without sparsification for a certain number of epochs, then trained to be increasingly sparse, and then fine-tuned with a fixed sparsity pattern at the end.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While I find the overall approach of the paper interesting, currently the experiments are not systematic enough to derive clear insights from the paper.	O	O	Review	20401
Hence I unfortunately recommend rejecting the paper at this point.	O	O	Review	20401
I hope the authors find time to conduct more systematic experiments for a future version of the paper.	B-Review	B-10	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Concretely, the following would be interesting experiments / questions:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- How effective is the proposed training method on architectures other than ResNets?	B-Review	B-1	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- What happens if the "pruning era" is made longer, started substantially earlier, or started substantially later?	B-Review	B-2	Review	20401
Currently it is not clear if the epoch 30 - 50 pruning era is (approximately) optimal and how much performance varies with begin and end of the pruning era.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Due to the small variation between some of the methods, it would be good to investigate how robust the ordering is when the experiment is re-ran with different random seeds etc.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]In addition, I have the following suggestions:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The authors may want to remove or enhance the adversarial robustness evaluation.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20401
Currently the authors only evaluate robustness against FGSM, but it is well known that iterative attacks such as PGD are more effective.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Instead of "intra-epoch pruning" or "intra", the name "combined" may be more clear for the combined method.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- In the description of the experimental setup, it could be good to specify what GPUs were used (since this lead to the smaller batch size).	B-Review	B-6	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- It could be helpful for the reader to discuss how predictive results on Tiny-ImageNet are for results on ImageNet.	B-Review	B-7	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- In Table 2, it would be good to add context by comparing to prior work with sparsity level 60% and some of the compression-focused methods from Table 4.	B-Review	B-8	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- In the comparison to Mao et al (2017), it could be good to clarify that they also work with ResNet models on ImageNet.	B-Review	B-9	Review	20401
[line_break_token]	O	O	Review	20401
1) Our argument for only using one architecture is that Resnet networks are the benchmark for MLPerf and the hardest/longest networks to train.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20401
All other recent work on CNNs use Resnet, on Imagenet and some smaller datasets, as well.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20401
However, to address this concern we will add experiments on VGG.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20401
[line_break_token] [line_break_token](2) The main goal of this approach is to restrict the pruning era to reduce complexity especially on accelerators.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20401
We also aimed to reach a fixed sparsity mask as early as possible.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20401
Keeping the above goal in mind, we did perform sensitivity analysis (shown in Table 1) keeping the final convergence accuracy as high as possible.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20401
We demonstrated that shrinking the pruning era damages the accuracy.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20401
On top of that we moved the pruning era 10 epochs earlier or later in training and studied wider pruning schedules.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20401

SUMMARY[line_break_token]-------[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper explores a series of incremental variations of existing pruning techniques for compressing Resnet-50 for ImageNet.	O	O	Review	20401
Specifically, it proposes concentrating all pruning during an early "era" of training (the first 20-50 epochs out of 100 total).	O	O	Review	20401
It also explores hybrids between sparse pruning and structured pruning.	O	O	Review	20401
Finally, it considers the adversarial robustness of the resulting networks to the FGSM attack.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper makes no novel proposals and experiments are minimal.	O	O	Review	20401
There are no clear takeaways from the results of these experiments.	O	O	Review	20401
The goals of the paper are unclear, and it is difficult to compare this paper to existing work.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper has no clear motivation and makes no tangible contributions to the literature and, therefore, I recommend a rejection.	O	O	Review	20401

[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]DETAILED COMMENTS[line_break_token]------[line_break_token][line_break_token]PROBLEMS ADDRESSED[line_break_token][line_break_token]It was challenging to discern the specific problems that this paper sought to address and, relatedly, the goals that the paper sought to achieve.	O	O	Review	20401
The introduction of the paper lists a wide variety of problems in the existing literature:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) Paragraph 3: Structured sparsity introduces "regularization and computational overhead."	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]2) Paragraph 3: "Coarse-grained sparsity" cannot eliminate enough parameters to perform well on "edge devices."	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]3) Paragraph 4: Dynamic sparsity techniques require more training epochs.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]4) Paragraph 4: Dynamic sparsity techniques do not preserve network accuracy (1-2 percentage point drop at 80% sparsity).	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]5) Paragraph 4: Dynamic sparsity requires reconfiguring the sparsity pattern frequently, which is computationally expensive.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper does not justify the fact that any of these are actually problems, nor does it make any attempt to quantify the extent of these problems.	O	O	Review	20401
Moreover, the proposed techniques do not resolve any of these problems.	O	O	Review	20401
Corresponding to the numbers above:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) The paper never measures this overhead nor justifies that it is a problem in practice.	O	O	Review	20401
Meanwhile, the techniques proposed in the paper introduce substantial overhad of their own, including training for an extra ten epochs.	O	O	Review	20401
It is possible that the techniques proposed in this paper have worse overhead than the techniques that are criticized in the introduction.	O	O	Review	20401
Since the paper provides on numbers either way, it is impossible to tell.	O	O	Review	20401
In short, computational cost is a key part of the author's argument despite the fact that there is no empirical support for any of these claims.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) I believe the paper means that, in order to get to sufficient levels of sparsity to work on "edge devices," accuracy drops unacceptably far.	O	O	Review	20401
What does the paper mean by "edge devices," what are sufficient levels of sparsity, and what does it mean for accuracy to drop unacceptably far?	O	O	Review	20401
The paper has numbers for the proposed methods, so it should be possible to make this comparison if such baselines are explicit.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) The proposed techniques also require the same number of additional training epochs, so this complaint is unaddressed.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4) The proposed techniques show a 2-3 percentage point drop at 80% sparsity (Table 1), which is actually worse than the technique that the authors criticize.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]5) The proposed techniques require pruning after every single training step during the "pruning era."	O	O	Review	20401
This is likely to be more computationally expensive than any of the other gradual pruning and dynamic sparsity techniques listed, which prune at intervals of hundreds or thousands of iterations.	O	O	Review	20401
In addition, the authors never justify why changing the sparsity pattern frequently throughout training will affect performance.	O	O	Review	20401
On GPUs with modern frameworks, I see no reason why this should matter so long as the sparsity pattern does not change too frequently (although that is exactly what this paper proposes to do during the "pruning era").	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]GOALS[line_break_token][line_break_token]It was also challenging to discern the goals of the paper.	O	O	Review	20401
Was it:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) To produce the smallest possible trained networks with the highest possible accuracy?	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) To reduce the cost of obtaining a pruned network for inference-time? (	O	O	Review	20401
Or to reduce the cost of obtaining a sufficiently efficient pruned network for inference-time?)	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) To reduce the cost of training neural networks in general by pruning them during training?	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the introduction and the related work section, these goals go unstated, making it difficult to determine how this paper compares to existing work.	O	O	Review	20401
The comparisons provided in the paper focus on specific aspects of each related work rather than the entire picture.	O	O	Review	20401
For example, in comparison to Mao et al the authors claim better accuracy at one sparsity level, implying goal 1.	O	O	Review	20401
However, for to Lym et al the paper focuses on the computational costs of training the network, implying goal 3.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]UNJUSTIFIED CLAIMS ABOUT NEURAL NETWORK COMPUTATION[line_break_token][line_break_token]Throughout the paper, there are a number of unjustified claims about which neural network configurations will perform better on contemporary hardware.	O	O	Review	20401
Considering computational efficiency appears to be a key element of the paper's argument, these claims require citations or - particularly when various configurations are compared to one another - empirical support.	O	O	Review	20401
Some examples:[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Section 1, Paragraph 3: "The regularization term [of structured sparsity] modifies the original training and can be expensive in hardware."	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]* Section 1, Paragraph 3: "The final network [from Lym et al 2019] contains an insufficient degree of sparsity for deployment on edge devices."	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]* Section 1, Paragraph 4: "Continuous reconfiguration of the sparsity pattern is expensive as it does not allow for compression of weights during training"[line_break_token]* Section 1, Paragraph 5: "having a fixed sparse multiply-accumulate pattern allows weight compression during training and can save compute and energy in hardware"[line_break_token]* Section 5, Paragraph 2: "A strict parameter allows the hardware mapping to plan for a fixed number of multiply-accumulate operations."	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]* Section 5, Paragraph 2: "Regularization, although useful in forcing the network to learn prunable weights, adds more irregularity to computation flow."	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]PRUNING TECHNIQUES[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Recomputing the pruning mask at every training step seems gratuitously inefficient.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]* Sorting the weights in the entire network shouldn't be particularly inefficient if it isn't done on every single iteration. (	O	O	Review	20401
Section 2.1 paragraph 1)[line_break_token]* Why do you maintain the same number of weights in each convolutional filter with window pruning? (	O	O	Review	20401
Presumably for performance reasons, but you never say that.)	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]* None of the pruning methods are novel.	O	O	Review	20401
They're simply various permutations of structured and unstructured magnitude pruning as proposed by many others in the literature.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]EXPERIMENTS[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Section 3.1 Paragraph 2: It appears that you are exploring the best "pruning era."	O	O	Review	20401
If you are to do so, you will have to sweep over (1) the length of the pruning era (2) the starting epoch of the pruning era, and (3) the shape of the function used to determine sparsity.	O	O	Review	20401
Instead, it sounds like you tried two arbitrary pruning eras (0-30 and 30-50).	O	O	Review	20401
Likewise, in Paragraph 3, you test only a small number of possible scenarios.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]* Section 3.1 is generally hard to parse.	O	O	Review	20401
It is unclear what you are studying.	O	O	Review	20401
The ideal pruning era?	O	O	Review	20401
The relative performance of the pruning methods introduced in section 2?	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]* How many times did you replicate each experiment?	O	O	Review	20401
You should ideally include at least 3 (and preferrably 5) replicates with mean and stddev reported.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]* What baselines are you including?	O	O	Review	20401
You should include a random pruning baseline and you should ideally replicate any methods that you compare to.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]RESULTS[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Section 4.1: The data you refer to is in an appendix even though it is crucial to the main body of the paper.	O	O	Review	20401
The appendices should contain material that is nonessential for making sense of the paper.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]* Section 4.2 Paragraph 1: Are these numbers good?	O	O	Review	20401
A standard sparse pruning technique (Gale et al 2019, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09574.pdf)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09574.pdf)</a> achieve 70% sparsity without any change in accuracy.	O	O	Review	20401
Please include baselines comparing to other methods in the literature.	O	O	Review	20401

PruneTrain aims to reduce the cost of training and measures cost reductions in FLOPS.	O	O	Review	20401
If you intend to compare against this paper, you should quantify the cost of training using your method against that of PruneTrain.	O	O	Review	20401
Merely presenting sparsity and accuracy numbers is insufficient.	O	O	Review	20401
Likewise for the dynamic sparsity experiments.	O	O	Review	20401
What is your goal in showing this comparison, and did Mostafa and Wang share that goal when they justified their technique?	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]* You do not describe the hyperparameters for Intraepoch pruning (the balance between window and CK - last paragraph of 2.1.1)[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]ADVERSARIAL ROBUSTNESS[line_break_token][line_break_token]Considering the fact that this paper focuses on proposing new variations of existing pruning techniques, any discussion of adversarial robustness seems to be (1) out of place and (2) an afterthought.	O	O	Review	20401
If the authors delete a half-page of content (one phrase from the abstract, a paragraph and bullet from the introduction, and a paragraph each from sections 3 and 4), this content could be removed with minimal impact to the paper's main contributions.	O	O	Review	20401
The content on adversarial robustness is cursory, uses a weak and out-of-date attack (FGSM), and does not compare to any other pruning methods.	O	O	Review	20401
In fact, the one comparison is to the results in a paper (Wang et al, 2018) that looks at both FGSM and PGD (a stronger attack) on completely different networks and tasks (MNIST and CIFAR10).	O	O	Review	20401
The paper would be stronger if content on adversarial robustness was removed entirely.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]OTHER MINOR COMMENTS[line_break_token][line_break_token]* The title includes the word "starfire," but it never appears again in the paper.	O	O	Review	20401
The paper proposes no specific technique, so there isn't anything to name.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token]* Use the \ begin{appendix} command before you create the appendices and the \ end{appendix} command when you are done.	O	O	Review	20401

[line_break_token]Just to give context:[line_break_token]1) Regularization contains operations such as vector norm (normalization, divide, square root) that are not typically multiply accumulate nature and hence are expensive for accelerators and GPUs as they are atypical with high latency.	O	O	Reply	20401
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]2) Sorry for the miscommunication, our meaning with this sentence was that the levels of sparsity in previous coarse grain sparsity methods were not high-enough for a given convergence accuracy.	O	O	Reply	20401
Therefore, the overheads incurred to handle sparsity (indexing/compression/decompression) were not justified.	O	O	Reply	20401
Our main point is that edge devices are one example area where a high level of coarse grained sparsity while maintaining accuracy is desirable, and this paper achieved this goal.	O	O	Reply	20401

[line_break_token] [line_break_token] [line_break_token](3) We can show the nature of the computation incurred for reparametrization.	O	O	Reply	20401
While the point is taken that we have no empirical study to support this, we make the argument that our overheads are minimal given that they are only incurred during 20% of total training schedule and that we eliminated regularization overheads.	O	O	Reply	20401
Also, we update the sparsity only for a total of 20 times once/epoch during pruning era (again this was misrepresented in Algorithm 1 and will be corrected).	O	O	Reply	20401
[line_break_token]  [line_break_token](4) The reason we mentioned edge devices was to highlight that the accuracy drop does not justify using low levels of sparsity because the overheads of indexing/compression/decompression are higher than just keeping data dense. [	O	O	Reply	20401

This paper introduces a strategy to prune a convolutional neural network during training.	O	O	Review	20401
To speed up training, the proposed method prunes the weights with the smallest magnitude during only a small number of epochs at the beginning of training, later on continuing training with a fixed sparsity pattern.	O	O	Review	20401
Several granularity levels for convolutional and fully-connected layers are studied.	O	O	Review	20401
Furthermore, the robustness of the resulting pruned networks to adversarial attacks is investigated.	O	O	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Originality:[line_break_token]- As acknowledged at the beginning of section two, the general pruning strategy used here is very similar to that introduced by Narang et al 2017.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20401
While the authors argued that the threshold is computed in a different manner, it also increases gradually during training, as in Narang et al 2017.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20401
[line_break_token]- I acknowledge that Narang et al 2017 focuses on RNNs, while here the focus is on CNNs.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20401
However, the originality of the different pruning strategies used here for convolutional and fully-connected layers is very limited.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20401
In essence, these strategies directly follow those studied by Mao et al 2017.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20401
[line_break_token]- The study of robustness to adversarial attacks, while interesting, is also not novel per se, as the idea of performing such a study was proposed in Wang et al  2018.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20401
I acknowledge that the conclusions drawn here differ from those in Wang et al 2018.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20401
However, there are no explanations for this different behavior.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Methodology:[line_break_token]- While the beginning of Section 2 states that the pruning threshold gradually increases during training, the specific way this is achieved is not clearly explained.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20401
[line_break_token]- The pruning strategies depicted by Fig.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20401
2, whether for convolutional layers or for fully-connected ones, never aim to remove entire output channels.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20401
However, the only way to truly end up with a smaller network is to remove entire channels and/or layers, as argued in Wen et al 2016 and in Alvarez &amp; Salzmann, NIPS 2016, as well as studied in Mao et al 2017 via the filter-level granularity.	O	O	Review	20401
It is unclear to me how speed would be affected by having a network with the same number of channels and layers, but many parameters set to zero.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experiments:[line_break_token]- The experiments show the good behavior of the proposed algorithm in terms of sparsity vs accuracy tradeoff.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20401
However, while the introduction seems to focus on the benefits of the proposed method in terms of training speed, these benefits are not demonstrated in the experiments, where no timings (neither for training not for inference) are reported.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20401
[line_break_token]- As mentioned above, it is not clear to me that the speedup will be significant if the sparsity pattern does not remove entire channels, but I am willing to be proven wrong.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20401
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Summary:[line_break_token]My main concern about this paper is its novelty, as the method essentially uses the method of Narang et al 2017, albeit with a different threshold, with the sparsity patterns of Mao et al 2017.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20401
The experiments demonstrate that the method is effective at pruning, but do not provide any timings to evaluate the resulting speedups.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20401
1) We agree that our method is similar to Narang et al; however, achieving high levels of accuracy and high levels of structured sparsity for CNNs was missing; we contribute substantial experiments to find the limits of the final level of sparsity and how few epochs we can train for CNN.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20401
Also, Narang et al prune after every iteration while we prune after every epoch (for as little as 20 epochs out of 90), so there are much fewer updates in our method.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20401
We grant that the adversarial is not exactly novel.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20401
However, our goal was to investigate the robustness in presence of structured sparsity.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20401
[line_break_token] [line_break_token](2) Thank you for pointing out that this is unclear.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20401
The gradual pruning is done as shown in Fig 1, but we will add prose to explain the process.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20401
Our goal is to provide structured sparsity, rather than speed up training, that is we would like to reduce the memory footprint but also structure it in a highly regular way that could be exploited by a hardware accelerator.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20401
As you say, this is setting parameters to 0, which is the goal of many.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20401
Please see Table 4 for a number of them.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20401
On top of that, all the hardware accelerators put mechanisms to skip computations with zeros please see reference [Han 2015b] for an example.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20401
[line_break_token] [line_break_token](3) The background in the introduction regarding speedup seems to have mischaracterized our main intentions, so we will clarify that it is mainly to provide structured sparsity while maintaining accuracy.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20401
However, we would like to note that we noted we would get speedups from sparsification because we would reduce the total number of computations [Zhu et al 2019] [Parashar et al 2017] by having a small number of epochs in which we do pruning and fixing the sparsity masks to their final values early in training rather than sparsifying until the end of training or after training.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper by Leonard et al is quite a bit different than what you are doing.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	78
You are trying to learn which values are zero after using a standard training procedure.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	78
Leonard et al are training a net to intentionally *make more of the activations zero*. Their procedure explicitly groups the zeros into contiguous blocks, so that the indexing logic required to ignore the zeros is cheap.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	78
Also, the secondary network used to determine which blocks should be computed is significantly smaller than the primary classification network.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	78
In your case, the secondary network has the same number of outputs as the primary network has hidden units.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	78

This is being worked on at the moment.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	78
However, we see a fundamental difference to the mentioned approaches (VAE, ladder networks).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	78
Due to the pairwise loss an inter-sample comparison is achieved, while the mentioned methods only optimize for the current input sample.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	78
From the paper it can be seen that due to this inter-sample comparison we can not only extract features but can make them distinct, which helps for the intended exploration of a dataset.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	78
Having said this, a comparison to these other approaches will definitely strengthen the paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	78
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The dataset has been chosen to be close to the designated application.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	78
Therefore key aspects of the presented work rely on the specific application scenario (e.g. time-dependency, variety of sound sources).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	78
Available references like for the TIMIT dataset are not suitable for a fair comparison, since the applied algorithms are optimized for speech/phonetic classification while our proposed approach is designed to work for general audio analysis without prior knowledge.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	78
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Despite its relation to the application the used AED dataset has been chosen because it contains a large number of samples per category (around 20 minutes/category), which is beneficial to train the network, whereas ESC-50 ( <a href="https://github.com/karoldvl/ESC-50" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/karoldvl/ESC-50</a> ) and DCASE2016 ( <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2016/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/dcase2016/</a> ) contain less training samples (3 minutes/category and <1 minute/category, respectively).

[line_break_token][line_break_token]## Overall[line_break_token][line_break_token]The article proposes a method of modifying image-generating networks to also produce depth maps in an unsupervised way by enforcing rotational consistency.	O	O	Review	78
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I enjoyed reading this work and I'm recommending it to be accepted.	O	O	Review	78
However, first there are some (in my opinion straight-forward) changes that need to be made to this work before I can recommend its publication: [line_break_token][line_break_token]- The common "Related Works" section is missing and some of the literature is taking place in the introduction.	B-Review	B-1	Review	78
I find this unorganized and I'd recommend keeping the intro shorter and just moving the literature either behind the intro or to the end of the paper.	I-Review	I-1	Review	78
[line_break_token]- Most figures and especially your headline figure (1) suffer from not having the depth normalized and not having a scale to it.	B-Review	B-2	Review	78
The fix for this is simple and two-fold: for each depth image, subtract the minimum value and divide by the range (to normalize it and increase contrast), then write in the caption or as a legend that white is closer to the camera and black is further back.	I-Review	I-2	Review	78
[line_break_token]- 3D vs. 2.5D - If the common geometric definition of "3D" was applied here, the article's title was correct.	B-Review	B-3	Review	78
However, in computer vision and especially 3D vision, the term is commonly used to refer only to models that include full scene geometry, including the occluded backs of objects and the term 2.5D is used to describe assigning depth values to pixels in an RGB image (and therefore only covering the view-dependent front of the object), which I think is the case here.	I-Review	I-3	Review	78
However, this is not a hill that I'll die on so if you insist on that terminology, I won't block acceptance.	I-Review	I-3	Review	78
[line_break_token]- When you first discuss HoloGAN, you mention one of its main downsides being scalability and then proceed to not only explain that but also use a HoloGAN-like architecture in one of your experiments.	B-Review	B-4	Review	78
I'd either remove the scalability argument or justify not just that but also how that's not relevant to your experiments.	I-Review	I-4	Review	78
[line_break_token]- The following phrase occurs multiple times throughout: "camera parameter conditional image generation".	B-Review	B-5	Review	78
I _think_ you're missing a dash between "parameter" and "conditional".	I-Review	I-5	Review	78
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]## Specific comments and questions[line_break_token][line_break_token]### Abstract[line_break_token][line_break_token]All good.	O	O	Review	78
[line_break_token][line_break_token]### Intro[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Fig.1 normalize image [line_break_token]- The literature section in intro mentions "For all methods, 3D annotations must be used..." - that's not true.	B-Review	B-6	Review	78
See [Rezende, 2016][1] and [Rajeswar, 2018][2][line_break_token]- I understand how some literature is required to position your method, but I think it's better to not have the entire literature section in the center of the introduction[line_break_token][line_break_token][1]: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00662" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00662</a>[line_break_token][2]: <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJeem3C9F7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJeem3C9F7</a>[line_break_token][line_break_token]### Method[line_break_token][line_break_token]- 2.1 clear + nicely written[line_break_token]- Figure 2 good, caption a bit too short - figure+caption should be able to stand on their own[line_break_token]- Illustration of Figure 3 nice, except for unclear DeepVoxel part: what's the wavy orange flag stand for?

[line_break_token][line_break_token]### Experiments[line_break_token][line_break_token]- You mention K is fixed, but where does the initial K come from?	B-Review	B-12	Review	78
I assume it's just neglected (since it's not important for StyleGAN/PGGAN), but then this needs to be mentioned in the methods sections closer to the formulas dealing with K.[line_break_token]- Figure 4 - the depth maps need to be normalized.	B-Review	B-13	Review	78

[line_break_token][line_break_token]3D vs. 2.5D[line_break_token]- Our model can not only generate RGBD images, which is commonly considered 2.5D, but also explicitly control camera poses while preserving the image content.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	78
Therefore, it can be regarded that the model can learn full 3D geometry implicitly, though the output is not fully 3D. This is the intuition to use the word "3D".	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	78
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Scalability of HoloGAN[line_break_token]- We agree that the badness of the scalability of HoloGAN is not supported by our experimental results.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	78

We agree that the figure is ambiguous, we will replace the figure.	I-Reply	I-11	Reply	78
[line_break_token][line_break_token]About K[line_break_token]- Because learning K from single images is difficult, we initialize K with [[2s, 0, s/2], [0, 2s, s/2], [0, 0, 1]] (numpy-style order), where is image size.	B-Reply	B-12	Reply	78
We will add the explanation in the paper.	I-Reply	I-12	Reply	78
[line_break_token][line_break_token]floor/sky[line_break_token]- We did not try adding floor or sky to render the ShapeNet car dataset.	B-Reply	B-14	Reply	78
We think adding simple sky or floor will help learning depth information to some extent, but it is difficult to learn consistent depth.	I-Reply	I-14	Reply	78
This is because foreground regions have common salient concepts across views (eg.	I-Reply	I-14	Reply	78
tire, headlight, window, ...) but the background does not.	I-Reply	I-14	Reply	78
This is also problematic when we train the model on a car image dataset, which has floor and sky, as shown in Figure 7.	I-Reply	I-14	Reply	78
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Evaluation for depth[line_break_token]- Evaluating the generated depth is difficult because we cannot obtain ground truth depth for the generated images.	B-Reply	B-16	Reply	78
A possible approach to evaluate depth images without ground truth images is calculating the inception score (IS) [5] or FID on the generated depth images, but we do not think it is appropriate.	I-Reply	I-16	Reply	78
This is because IS and FID are estimated in the feature space of a pre-trained CNN, and they cannot consider the geometry in the 3D world.	I-Reply	I-16	Reply	78
Therefore it is almost impossible to evaluate how the generated depth is plausible in 3D space.	I-Reply	I-16	Reply	78
Instead, we will evaluate the depth consistency across views to quantitatively compare the generated depth among different methods.	I-Reply	I-16	Reply	78
When we plot point clouds generated from the same but different, all points should be on a single surface.	I-Reply	I-16	Reply	78
Therefore, by calculating the variation of the generated depth, we can quantitatively evaluate the 3D consistency across views.	I-Reply	I-16	Reply	78
It is expected that 3D-latent-feature-based models have better performance than other models.	I-Reply	I-16	Reply	78

This paper presents a method for unsupervised representation learning of speech.	O	O	Review	219
The idea is to first learn discrete representation (vector quantization is done by Gumbel softmax or k-means) from audio samples with contrastive prediction coding type objective, and then perform BERT-style pre-training (borrowed from NLP).	O	O	Review	219
The BERT features are used as inputs to ASR systems, rather than the usual log-mel features.	O	O	Review	219
The idea, which combines those of previous work (wav2vec and BERT) synergetically, is intuitive and clearly presented, significant improvements over log-mel and wav2vec were achieved on ASR benchmarks WSJ and TIMIT.	O	O	Review	219
Based on these merits, I suggest this paper to be accepted.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]On the other hand, I would suggest directions for investigation and improvements as follows.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	219
While I understand that vector quantization makes the use of NLP-style BERT-training possible (as the inputs to NLP models are discrete tokens),  there are potential disadvantages as well.	B-Review	B-1	Review	219
One observation from the submission is that the token set may need to very large (from tens of thousands to millions) for the system to work well, making the BERT training computationally expensive (I noticed that the BERT model is trained on 128 GPUs).	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
Also, without BERT pre-training, using directly the discrete tokens seems to consistently give worse performance for ASR.	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
I think some more motivations or explorations (what kind of information did BERT learn) are needed to understand why that is the case.	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	219
Besides the computational expensive-ness of the three-step approach (vector quantization, BERT, acoustic model training), the combined model complexity is large because these steps do not share neural network architecture.	B-Review	B-2	Review	219
A more economical approach is to use BERT-trained model as initialization for acoustic model training, which is the classical way how RBMs pre-training were used in ASR.	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	O	O	Review	219
One concern I have with discrete representation is how robust they are wrt different dataset.	B-Review	B-3	Review	219
The ASR datasets used in this work are relatively clean (but there does exists domain difference between them).	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
It remains to see how the method performs with more acoustically-challenging speech data, and how universally useful the learned features are (as is the case for BERT in NLP).	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4.	O	O	Review	219
Another curious question is whether the features would still provide as much improvement when a stronger ASR system than AutoSeg (e.g., Lattice-free MMI) is used.	B-Review	B-4	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, while I think the computational cost of the proposed method is high, rendering it less practical at this point, I believe the approach has potential and the result obtained so far is already significant.	O	O	Review	219

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Our BERT vocabulary sizes (13.5k for the gumbel version and 23k for the k-means version) compare favorably to the setups commonly used in NLP where vocabularies are double or triple of our sizes.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	219

We did not follow this direction due to two motivations: first, our aim is to contribute a new quantization scheme for audio data that is trained to predict the context in a self-supervised way.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	219
Second, we wanted to show that good performance can be achieved with discretized audio on actual speech tasks.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	219

[line_break_token]We agree that an ablation study on robustness of the embeddings across different datasets would be very interesting.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Here we are mostly focusing on relatively clean data (WSJ, TIMIT, Librispeech) following the original wav2vec paper but we would be interested in exploring robustness in the future.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	219
However we note that representations transfer at least well across datasets from the ‚Äúclean speech‚Äù domain: vq-wav2vec and BERT is only trained on Librispeech and never tuned on TIMIT/WSJ.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	219

Another curious question is whether the features would still provide as much improvement when a stronger ASR system than AutoSeg (e.g., Lattice-free MMI) is used.	O	O	Reply	219

In some sense, the LF-MMI result has an edge because it is based on a phoneme-based ASR system which is typically stronger than the character-based ASR system used with wav2vec.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	219
We agree that evaluation on stronger baselines is an important future direction though.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	219

The paper proposes a way to pre-train quantized representations for speech.	O	O	Review	219
The approach proposed is a two-stage process: 1.	O	O	Review	219
train a quantized version of wav2vec [my understanding is that wav2vec is the same thing as CPC for Audio except for using a binary cross-entropy loss instead of InfoNCE softmax-cross entropy loss]. the authors propose to use gumbel softmax / VQ codebook for the vector quantization.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	219
once you have a discrete representation, you could train BERT (as if it were a seq of language tokens).	O	O	Review	219
this makes a lot of sense especially given that CPC / wav2vec recovers phonemes and quantizing the phonemes will recover a language-like version of the raw audio.	O	O	Review	219
And running BERT across those tokens will allow you to capture the dependencies at the phoneme level.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]After pre-training, the authors use the learned representations for speech recognition.	O	O	Review	219
They compare this to using log-mel filterbanks.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The results (WER / LER) is lower for the proposed pipeline compared to using dense wav2vec representation for n-gram and character LM.	O	O	Review	219
 It also makes sense that BERT helps for the k-means (vq) setting since the number of codes is large.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors also cleverly adopt/adapt span-BERT which is more suited to this setting.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I think this paper presents a useful contribution as far as improving speech / phoneme recognition using self-supervised learning goes, and also has useful engineering aspects in terms of combining CPC and BERT.	O	O	Review	219

[line_break_token]Overview:[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper considers unsupervised (or self-supervised) discrete representation learning of speech using a combination of a recent vector quantized neural network discritization method and future time step prediction.	O	O	Review	219
Discrete representations are fine-tuned by using these as input to a BERT model; the resulting representations are then used instead of conventional speech features as the input to speech recognition models.	O	O	Review	219
New state-of-the-art results are achieved on two datasets.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Strengths:[line_break_token][line_break_token]The core strength of this paper is in the results that are achieved on standard speech recognition benchmarks.	O	O	Review	219
The results indicate that, while discritization in itself does not give improvements, coupling this with the BERT-objective results in speech features which are better in downstream speech recognition than standard features.	O	O	Review	219
I think the main technical novelty is in combining discritization with future time step prediction (but see the weakness below).	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weaknesses:[line_break_token][line_break_token]The main weakness of the paper is that it does not situate itself within existing literature in this area.	B-Review	B-1	Review	219
Over the last few years, researchers in the speech community have invested significant effort in learning better speech representations, and this is not discussed.	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
See e.g. [1]. Even more importantly, very recently there has been a number of papers investigating discrete representations of speech; see the review [2]. Some of these papers specifically use VQ-VAEs [3]. [4] actually compares VQ-VAE and the Gumbel-Softmax approach.	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
These studies should be mentioned.	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
This paper is different in that it incorporates future time step prediction.	I-Review	I-1	Review	219

In the longer run it would be extremely beneficial to the community if this approach is applied to the standard benchmarks as set out in [2].[line_break_token][line_break_token]As a minor weakness, some parts of the paper is not described in enough detail and the motivation is weak or not exactly clear (see detailed comments below).

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall assessment:[line_break_token][line_break_token]I think the results as well as the new combination of existing approaches in the paper warrants publication.	B-Review	B-10	Review	219

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Detailed questions and suggestions:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Section 1: As motivation for this work, it is stated that "we aim to make well performing NLP algorithms more widely applicable".	B-Review	B-3	Review	219
As noted above, some NLP-like ideas (such as prediction of future speech segments, stemming from text-based language modelling) have already been considered within the speech community.	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
Rather than motivating the work in this way, it might be helpful to focus the contribution as a combination of future time step prediction and discretization (both of which have been considered in previous work, but not in combination).	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
[line_break_token]- Section 4: Would it be possible to train the vq-wav2vec model jointly with BERT, i.e. as one model?	B-Review	B-4	Review	219
I suspect it would be difficult since, for the masking objective, the discrete units are already required, but maybe there is a scheme where this could work.	I-Review	I-4	Review	219
[line_break_token]- Section 2.2: Similarly to the above question, would there be a way to incorporate the BERT principles directly into an end-to-end model, e.g. by randomly masking some of the continuous input speech?	B-Review	B-5	Review	219
[line_break_token]- Section 3.3: What exactly does "mode collapse" refer to in this context?	B-Review	B-6	Review	219
Would this be using only one codebook entry, for instance?	I-Review	I-6	Review	219
[line_break_token]- Section 6: It seems that in all cases to obtain improvements from discritization, BERT is required on top of the vq-wav2vec discrete symbols.	B-Review	B-7	Review	219
Is it possible that the output acoustic model is simply better-matched to continuous rather than discrete input (direct vq-wav2vec gives discrete while BERT gives continuous)?	I-Review	I-7	Review	219
Would it make sense to train the wav2vec acoustic model on top of the vqvae codebook entries (e) instead of directly on the symbols?	I-Review	I-7	Review	219

We observed that in the ‚Äúfew group regime‚Äù (G=1...4), only a few of the available centroids per group are used and refer to this phenomenon as mode collapse ‚Äî for BERT training, this is actually favorable e.g. in the G=2, V=320 setting as it yields a codebook of acceptable size for NLP model training (13.5k/23k).

[line_break_token][line_break_token]We actually did what you suggest: when we train acoustic models on top of vq-wav2vec, we input the dense embedding vectors corresponding to the discrete codewords.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	219
On the other hand, we also trained an NLP sequence to sequence (Section 6.3) which takes the quantized audio codes as input and then generates the transcriptions.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	219

[line_break_token][line_break_token]We believe the reason the dense embeddings for the discrete codewords work less well is because they do not encode as much detailed context information as a representation built by wav2vec or BERT.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	219

[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper aims to study whether a learned reward function can serve as a locus of knowledge about the environment, that can be used to accelerate training of new agents.	O	O	Review	219
The authors create an algorithm that learns an intrinsic reward function, that when used to train a new agent over a ‚Äúlifetime‚Äù (which consists of multiple episodes), leads to the best cumulative reward over the lifetime.	O	O	Review	219
As a result, the learned intrinsic reward is incentivized to quickly ‚Äúteach‚Äù the agent when and where to explore to find out as-yet unknown information, and then exploit that information once there is no more to be had.	O	O	Review	219
Experiments on gridworlds demonstrate that these learned intrinsic rewards: 1.	O	O	Review	219
switch between early exploration and later exploitation, 2.	O	O	Review	219
explore only for information that is relevant for optimal behavior, 3.	O	O	Review	219
capture invariant causal relationships, and 4.	O	O	Review	219
can anticipate and adapt to changes in the extrinsic reward within a lifetime.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I very much appreciated the design of the environments to test for specific properties within the learning algorithm: I think these experiments provide a very useful conceptual analysis of what learned intrinsic rewards can do.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My main qualm with the paper is with its significance -- the authors claim that the goal is to find out whether reward functions can be loci of knowledge, but we already know the answer is yes: the whole point of reward shaping is to improve training dynamics by building in knowledge into the reward function.	B-Review	B-1	Review	219
It is not a surprise that learned reward functions can be loci of knowledge if our hand-designed reward functions already do so.	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To me, the more interesting aspect of this paper is how much benefit we can get by learning intrinsic reward functions, relative to other ways of improving training dynamics.	B-Review	B-2	Review	219
The authors do show that by allowing the intrinsic reward to be recurrent (and so dependent on past episodes), it is able to first incentivize exploration and later exploitation, which standard reward shaping cannot do (since usually reward shaping still maintains the assumption that the reward is a function of the state).	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
However, given this motivation, it would be important to see comparisons between the proposed method of learning intrinsic rewards, and other methods for fast adaptation in the literature, such as MAML, which as I understand also has many of the properties highlighted in this paper.	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Ideally there would also be experiments on more complex environments: the environments in the paper have 104, 25, and 49 states.	B-Review	B-3	Review	219
If we in the ABC environments if you count ‚Äúwhether or not reward(object) is known‚Äù as part of the state, that multiplies it by 2^3 = 8 giving 200 and 392 states, if you then further add the ordering of r(A), r(B), and r(C), that multiplies by a factor of 3!	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
= 6 giving 1200 and 2352 states.	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
These environments are excellent for demonstrating the properties of learned intrinsic rewards and I am glad the authors have done these experiments and analyzed the results.	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
However, given that the paper aims to scale the optimal reward problem, it would have been useful to see examples where the state space cannot be fully enumerated to evaluate scalability.	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Questions:[line_break_token][line_break_token]In Figure 5, in episode 1, why is the learned intrinsic reward heavily penalizing the path to C, but not penalizing the path to B?	B-Review	B-4	Review	219
In the initial episode, the intrinsic reward should only know that B is to be avoided; it doesn‚Äôt yet know whether A or C is the better object.	I-Review	I-4	Review	219
 I would expect the learned intrinsic reward to put similar positive rewards on the path to C and the path to A, and negative reward on the path to B. (It is slightly more likely that C is the best object.	I-Review	I-4	Review	219
This probably changes things slightly, but not significantly.)	I-Review	I-4	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Also in Figure 5, by episode 3, shouldn‚Äôt the final states (A or C) have intrinsic rewards of larger magnitude?	B-Review	B-5	Review	219
Otherwise the agent can go back and forth on the path to collect lots of intrinsic reward without terminating the episode, even though this wouldn‚Äôt get extrinsic reward.	I-Review	I-5	Review	219
hank you very much for constructive comments.	O	O	Reply	219
We address the questions below and reflected some of the suggestions in the revision (see the common response above).	O	O	Reply	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]# Regarding ‚Äúthe goal is to find out whether reward functions can be loci of knowledge‚Äù[line_break_token]We clarify that our goal is not just finding out whether it is possible to store knowledge into rewards.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	219
In fact, we acknowledge in the introduction that existing hand-designed rewards already show that they can be a locus of knowledge.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	219
Instead, our goal is to find out 1) whether it is feasible to capture knowledge in reward functions in a data-driven from the agent‚Äôs own experience rather than hand-designing them, 2) what kind of knowledge can be captured when they are ‚Äúlearned‚Äù rather than ‚Äúhand-designed‚Äù, and 3) to show that reward knowledge can generalise to new dynamics and new learning algorithms.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	219
We clarified this in the revision.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]# Regarding the benefits of learning intrinsic rewards in comparison to other methods[line_break_token]In Section 5, we added a comparison to RL^2 and MAML and added one more experiment demonstrating that the intrinsic rewards learned from actor-critic agents can generalise to a different kind of learning agents, i.e. Q-learning agents.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	219
Please see the common response for details.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]# Regarding more complex domains[line_break_token]We revised the paper with a new version of the key-box domain, where the map is a 9x9 grid world and objects are randomly placed for each episode.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	219
Due to the random placement, there are more than 3 billion distinct states.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	219
We acknowledge that this number is still tiny in comparison to domains with high-dimensional visual observations, but this shows that our method can scale up to larger domains, where it is infeasible to fully enumerate the entire state space.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]# Regarding questions about Figure 5[line_break_token]Regarding your question about episode 1, we conjecture that it is more optimal for the intrinsic reward to encourage the agent to commit to one particular object (either A or C) at the beginning of training.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	219
Otherwise, if the reward is equal for A and C, it would take more time for a ‚Äúrandomly-initialised‚Äù policy to learn to collect any of them, because going towards both objects are encouraged (and they are placed in the opposite positions).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	219
[line_break_token]Regarding your question about episode 3, the colors represent the return for each trajectory not per-step reward.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	219
Therefore, the agent would not gain more rewards by moving back and forth.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	219
Also, it is important to note that the intrinsic reward is a function of the agent‚Äôs history.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	219
So, it is very likely that the intrinsic reward would penalise if the agent keeps going back and forth without proper exploration/exploitation, which would be an interesting analysis to be done.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	219

[line_break_token]The paper proposes a meta-learning approach to learn reward functions for reinforcement learning agents.	O	O	Review	219
It defines an algorithm to optimize an intrinsic reward function for a distribution of tasks in order to maximise the agent‚Äôs lifetime rewards.	O	O	Review	219
The properties of this reward function and meta-learning algorithm  are investigated through a number of proof-of-concept experiments.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The meta-learning algorithm and the corresponding empirical investigation are the main contributions of the paper.	B-Review	B-6	Review	219
The algorithm seems to be similar to previous meta-learning approaches, but differs by introducing a lifetime value function.	I-Review	I-6	Review	219
While I thought the paper raises some interesting possibilities, I am currently leaning towards rejection.	O	O	Review	219
The proposed algorithm does not seem like a major innovation over cited previous work.	O	O	Review	219
The empirical evaluation provides a number of proof-of-concept ideas, but no in depth investigation of the properties of the approach.	O	O	Review	219
The theoretical properties of the approach are barely discussed.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Detailed remarks:[line_break_token][line_break_token]* The main addition to the meta-learning algorithm is the lifetime value function.	B-Review	B-1	Review	219
The authors mention multiple times that this is crucial to learning, but the properties of this value function are not really investigated or discussed in depth:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The authors mention that the value function must take into account changing future policies, but do not discuss this further.	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
The value function update seems to be a standard on-policy TD update with the lifetime return and the complete history as input.	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
The policy for this value function, however, is still a standard policy with only state as input (but it will be non-stationary over the agent lifetime).	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
It would be good to discuss this learning problem in more detail.	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
[line_break_token]- The algorithm uses an n-step return.	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
Is this important?	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
What effect does n have on learning?	I-Review	I-1	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Another issue which I would have liked being discussed in more detail is the non-stationarity of the learning problem in general.	B-Review	B-2	Review	219
Most of the approaches discussed in related work (e.g. shaping)  are aimed at learning/designing more informative reward functions.	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
These reward functions still fit in the MDP framework, however, and map from states and actions to rewards.	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
In the case of shaping approaches guarantees can be given that this does not alter the learning problem.	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
The intrinsic reward functions used in this paper map the full life-time history of the agent to rewards.	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
While this is a richer framework that can express more complicated tasks (like exploration over multiple episodes), it also invalidates many of the basic assumptions of reinforcement learning.	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
The rewards are now no longer Markovian when only observing the current state.	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
Moreover, the reward function will change over time.	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
To what extent does this require non-stationary / history-based policy and value function learning to solve these issues?	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
While some of these issues also apply to count based exploration strategies, (Strehl and Littman,2008 ) provided results that the  exploration bonuses result a Bellman Equation that accounts for uncertainties.	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
No real guarantees seem to exist here.	I-Review	I-2	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* The empirical contribution focuses on trying to answer a number of questions regarding the properties of the learnt intrinsic rewards.	B-Review	B-3	Review	219
I found these questions to be very broad, while the answers are mostly anecdotal evidence through proof-of-concept examples.	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
 These examples do show potential benefits of meta-learning intrinsic rewards, but I was somewhat disappointed that there was no more systematic investigation.	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
For example, questions like ‚Äòhow does the distribution of tasks affect intrinsic rewards‚Äô or ‚Äòdoes intrinsic reward generalise‚Äô are not really answered by providing metrics of performance or generalisation in controlled experiments, but by providing some example cases.	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
Several of these questions (including optimising exploration and dealing with non-stationarity) also seem to have been investigated to some extent in the original Optimal reward papers (Singh, 2009/2010).	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
It would be good to clearly indicate what we have learned beyond these previous results.	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* There seems to be a bit of a mismatch between the learning objective for intrinsic rewards in the optimal reward framework and the results shown in the experiments.	B-Review	B-4	Review	219
The learning objective aims to optimise lifetime rewards for a distribution of tasks.	I-Review	I-4	Review	219
Most of the experiments seem to analyse episodic reward performance and compare against single-task (or task agnostic) methods.	I-Review	I-4	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor comments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The architecture / parameterization of the lifetime value function does not seem to be defined anywhere.	B-Review	B-5	Review	219
Given that it takes histories as input I assume this is another RNN?	I-Review	I-5	Review	219
[line_break_token]- There seems to be some small overloading in the notation with \eta occasionally being used to denote the parameters of the reward function r_eta or the reward function itself.	I-Review	I-5	Review	219

Summary [line_break_token]The paper evaluates the intrinsic reward as a way of storing information about episodes.	O	O	Review	219
It adopts the optimal intrinsic reward setting (Singh'09), and extends its recent policy gradient implementation, LIRPG, to lifetime settings.	O	O	Review	219
The task in the lifetime setting is to learn an intrinsic reward such that when trained with it, the agent maximizes its total return over its lifetime.	O	O	Review	219
A lifetime is defined as a sequence of episodes, where the agent does not have memory of previous episodes, however, the function computing the intrinsic reward does.	O	O	Review	219
In proof-of-concept experiments, the paper demonstrates that the learned intrinsic reward captures properties of several gridworld environments and induces meaningful behavior in the agent, successfully transferring information from previous episodes.	O	O	Review	219
Interestingly, a state-based reward function also generalizes to agents with perturbed action spaces, showing that this way of storing information is agnostic to the agent‚Äôs action space.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Decision[line_break_token]The paper proposal is interesting and adequately evaluated, however, the impact of the paper might be limited by its limited technical novelty and lack of comparisons to strong baselines.	O	O	Review	219

Here, I will focus on scientific questions, answering which would significantly improve the quality of the paper.	O	O	Review	219
[line_break_token]- The biggest drawback of the paper is that the proposed method has an unfair advantage as it has a way of transmitting information across episodes, which the baselines do not (as stated on the bottom of page 5).	B-Review	B-3	Review	219
While the findings of this paper are interesting, it is unclear how it compares to methods that have memory of previous episodes, such as agents with non-episodic recurrent policies, or meta-learning agents such as Duan‚Äô16, Finn‚Äô17.	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
Is it possible that the proposed method e.g. scales better than recurrent policies due to compact representations or provides better generalization to things like action space changes?	I-Review	I-3	Review	219
[line_break_token]- How does the method compare to hand-designed intrinsic rewards on hard exploration games (such as montezuma‚Äôs revenge or pitfall Atari games)?	B-Review	B-4	Review	219
Since it can only learn to explore on games that it previously successfully solved, it is possible that a hand-designed intrinsic reward such as RND (Burda‚Äô19) would perform better on these hard games.	I-Review	I-4	Review	219
On the other hand, it is possible that the method will in fact perform better on these games due to more directed exploration.	I-Review	I-4	Review	219
[line_break_token]- How does the method compare to hand-designed intrinsic reward on out-of-distribution tasks?	B-Review	B-5	Review	219
Intuitively, the method should perform the worse the further from the training distribution the task is, while the hand-designed rewards will always perform similarly.	I-Review	I-5	Review	219
However, what is the extent to which the proposed method generalizes?	I-Review	I-5	Review	219
It is possible that this method would be very useful in practice if it generalized well.	I-Review	I-5	Review	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Other potentially related work.	B-Review	B-6	Review	219
[line_break_token]- Xu‚Äô18, Learning to Explore with Meta-Policy Gradient, is a relevant work that proposes a meta-learning framework for training an exploration policy.	I-Review	I-6	Review	219
[line_break_token]- Metz‚Äô19, Meta-Learning Update Rules for Unsupervised Representation Learning, is a conceptually relevant work that proposes to meta-learn loss functions for unsupervised learning (and there is more recent related work on this topic too).	I-Review	I-6	Review	219

B-Reply	B-4	Reply	219
We would like to explore scaling to hard exploration tasks like Montezuma‚Äôs Revenge as future work.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	219
[line_break_token][line_break_token]# Regarding comparison to hand-designed intrinsic rewards on out-of-distribution tasks[line_break_token]We demonstrated that the intrinsic reward can interpolate successfully within the same task distribution.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	219
However, it is unclear whether it can extrapolate to out-of-distribution tasks, as the neural network representation should successfully handle extrapolation, which is an active research topic in deep learning (e.g., disentangled representation).	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	219
We believe that more research including representation learning is needed to learn intrinsic rewards that can generalise well to out-of-distribution tasks.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	219

In this paper, the authors propose a novel segmentation scheme that combines the block motion vectors for feature warping, bi-directional propagation, and feature fusion.	O	O	Review	734
Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness compared with alternative methods.	O	O	Review	734
However, I still have several concern:[line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	734
As  the block motion vectors are generally rough estimation, it may damage the performance of the tasks.	B-Review	B-1	Review	734
The authors should further clarify how the imperfect estimation influence the performance, e.g., the Blocking artifacts.	I-Review	I-1	Review	734

Thanks very much for taking the time to review our paper.	O	O	Reply	734
[line_break_token][line_break_token](1) The fact that block motion vectors (BMVs) are rougher motion estimates than optical flow is actually discussed in our results section (Sec.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	734
4.1.2):[line_break_token][line_break_token]     ‚ÄúWhile motion vectors are slightly less accurate than optical flow in general, by cutting inference times by 53% on [line_break_token]     intermediate frames (Sec.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
3.3.1), prop-BMV enables operation at much lower keyframe intervals than optical flow to [line_break_token]     achieve the same inference speeds.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
This results in a much more favorable accuracy-throughput curve.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]As a specific example (from Table 1), to achieve throughput of ~13.5 fps on CamVid requires operating at keyframe interval 10 with prop-flow (63.1 mIoU) but only keyframe interval 5 with prop-BMV (65.9 mIoU), which enables ~3% higher mIoU.[line_break_token][line_break_token]In essence, because motion estimation with block motion vectors is *much* cheaper than motion estimation with optical flow, block motion vectors allow us to operate at lower keyframe intervals, and thus achieve *higher accuracy*, for a given inference speed, than optical flow.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
This holds even given the small head-to-head accuracy difference between flow and BMV.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This is one of the key findings of our paper, and we would be happy to clarify further.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As for blocking artifacts, these are minor, but visible in our qualitative outputs (Fig.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
8) -- for example, optical flow is better at preserving thin details, such as the street sign on the left (yellow in the segmentation output).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
In contrast, forward flow warping causes drastic distortion of moving objects (e.g. the ‚ÄúADAC‚Äù taxi), occluding objects in the background (e.g. the pedestrians).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
This is reflected in much lower *overall* quantitative accuracy (mIoU) for prop-flow than for inter-BMV.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
We will add a note about blocking artifacts to the caption of Fig.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734

[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token](2) Our choice is inspired by the use of optical flow, in previous work (e.g. DFF), to warp deep features.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	734
Like block motion, optical flow is also computed directly on image pixels (albeit with more complex methods, e.g. Lukas-Kanade [i] or Farneback [ii]), but is still able to effectively warp the intermediate representations of ResNet-based image/video recognition networks.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	734
The core reason that pixel-level motion estimates suffice for feature warping is that fully convolutional architectures, such as e.g. FCN [iii] or DeepLab [iv] for segmentation, *preserve spatial structure* in their intermediate representations.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	734

Our key point is that we exploit this temporal continuity to accelerate segmentation for practical applications, such as video analytics, interactive film editing, and autonomous perception.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	734
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To directly address the reviewer‚Äôs point that ‚Äúthe authors are expected to demonstrate when the motion [is] chaotic‚Äù, our techniques are not dependent on any particular structure in the motion vectors.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	734

[line_break_token][line_break_token](1) Limited novelty -- Our paper is very keen on the distinction between our work and Shelhamer et al (2016) and Zhu et al (2017).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	734
First, Shelhamer et al (2016) does not use optical flow, and instead simply copies features from frame to frame (and schedules this copying).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
Zhu et al (2017) then proposes an improvement to this scheme, forward feature warping with optical flow.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
In general, both these techniques fail to achieve speedups beyond small multiples of the baseline (< 3x), without impacting accuracy.	O	O	Reply	734
The key reason for this is that both feature copying and forward warping are unable to capture *new scene content*. In fast moving footage (e.g. driving footage), copied and warped features quickly become obsolete, and warping error compounds significantly (see e.g. qualitative outputs, Fig.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	734
8, in our paper).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In Inter-BMV, we exploit the observation that scenes tend to have semantic start and end points -- e.g. a pedestrian walking across a crosswalk, a car turning a street corner.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
This allows us to leverage bi-directional warping, a new idea, to strong effect.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
Our second insight -- that video is compressed by default in a temporally referential manner (e.g. P-/B-frames in H.264 video) -- lends itself to an alternate, computation-free motion estimation scheme.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
This, together with our observation that video can be more efficiently processed in mini-batches, e.g. of 10 frames, enables us to trade-off a small amount of latency for a large gain in throughput.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
Ten video frames consists of 330 ms of footage at 30 fps -- this is comparable to the human visual reaction time (230-400 ms, see studies [i]), yet allows us to accelerate segmentation by almost *6x* over frame-by-frame, while maintaining within 1-2% of baseline accuracy.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	734
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To the best of our knowledge, none of our core ideas -- (1) bi-directional feature warping, (2) the use of block motion vectors for deep representation warping, and (3) mini-batch processing of video to accelerate segmentation throughput -- have been proposed or published before.

# Paper summary[line_break_token]This paper advances a method for accelerating semantic segmentation on video content at higher resolutions.	O	O	Review	734
Semantic segmentation is typically performed over single images, while there is un-used redundancy between neighbouring frames.	O	O	Review	734
The authors propose exploiting this redundancy and leverage block motion vectors from MPEG H.264 video codec which encodes residual content between keyframes.	O	O	Review	734
The block motion vectors from H264 are here used to propagate feature maps from keyframes to neighbouring non-keyframe frames (in both temporal directions) avoiding thus an additional full forward pass through the network and integrate this in the training pipeline.	O	O	Review	734
Experimental results on CamVid and Cityscapes show that the proposed method gets competitive results while saving computational time.	O	O	Review	734
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]# Paper strengths[line_break_token]- This paper addresses a problem of interest for both academic and industrial purposes.	O	O	Review	734
[line_break_token]- The paper is clearly written and the authors argument well their contributions, adding relevant plots and qualitative results where necessary.	O	O	Review	734
[line_break_token]- The two-way interpolation with block motion vectors and the fusion of interpolated features are novel and seem effective.	O	O	Review	734
[line_break_token]- The experimental results, in particular for the two-way BMV interpolation, are encouraging.	O	O	Review	734
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]# Paper weaknesses[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The idea of using Block Motion Vectors from compressed videos (x264, xvid) to capture motion with low-cost has been previously proposed and studied by Kantorov and Laptev [i] in the context of human action recognition.	B-Review	B-1	Review	734
Flow vectors are obtained with bilinear interpolation from motion blocks between neighbouring frames.	I-Review	I-1	Review	734
Vectors are then encoded in Fisher vectors and not used with CNNs as done in this paper.	I-Review	I-1	Review	734
In both works, block motion vectors are used as low-cost alternatives to dense optical flow.	I-Review	I-1	Review	734
I would suggest to cite this work and discuss similarities and differences.	I-Review	I-1	Review	734
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]- Regarding the evaluation of the method, some recent methods dealing with video semantic segmentation, also using ResNet101 as backbone, are missing, e.g. low latency video semantic segmentation[ii]. Pioneer Clockwork convnets are also a worthy baseline in particular in terms of computational time (results and running times on CityScapes are shown in [ii]).	B-Review	B-2	Review	734
It would be useful to include and compare against them.	I-Review	I-2	Review	734
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- In Section 4.1.2 page 7 the authors mention a few recent single-frame models ((Yu et al (2017); Chen et al (2017); Lin et al (2017); Bilinski & Prisacariu (2018)) as SOTA methods and the current method is competitive with them.	O	O	Review	734
However I do not see the results from the mentioned papers in the referenced Figures.	B-Review	B-3	Review	734
Is this intended?	I-Review	I-3	Review	734
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- On a more general note related to this family of approaches, I feel that their evaluation is usually not fully eloquent.	B-Review	B-4	Review	734
Authors compare against similar pipelines for static processing and show gains in terms of computation time.	I-Review	I-4	Review	734
The backbone architecture, ResNet-101 is already costly for high-resolution inputs to begin with and avoiding a full-forward pass brings quite some gains (though a part of this gain is subsequently attenuated by the latency caused by the batch processing of the videos).	I-Review	I-4	Review	734
There are recent works in semantic segmentation that focus on architectures with less FLOPs or memory requirements than ResNet101, e.g. Dilated ResNets [iii], LinkNet[iv]. So it could be expected that image-based pipelines to be getting similar or better performance in less time.	I-Review	I-4	Review	734
I expect the computational gain on such architectures when using the proposed video processing method to be lower than for ResNet101, and it would make the decision of switching to video processing or staying with frame-based predictions more complex.	I-Review	I-4	Review	734
[line_break_token]The advantage of static image processing is simpler processing pipelines at test time without extra parameters to tune.	I-Review	I-4	Review	734
It would be interesting and useful to compare with such approaches on more even grounds.	I-Review	I-4	Review	734
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]# Conclusion [line_break_token]This paper takes on an interesting problem and achieves interesting results.	O	O	Review	734
The use of Block Motion Vectors has been proposed before in [i] and the main novelty of the paper remains only the interpolation of feature maps using BMVC.	O	O	Review	734

This paper shows that a penalty term called rugosity captures the implicit regularization effect of deep neural networks with ReLU (and piecewise affine in general) activation.	O	O	Review	20231
Roughly, rugosity measures how far the function parametrized as a deep network deviates from a locally linear function.	O	O	Review	20231
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper starts by showing that the amount of training loss increased from adding data augmentation is upper bounded in terms of (roughly) a Monte Carlo approximate to a Hessian based measure of rugosity.	O	O	Review	20231
It then formally derives this measure of rugosity for networks with continuous piecewise affine activations.	O	O	Review	20231
Finally, experimental evaluation for classification tasks on MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR shows that data augmentation indeed reduces the rogusity by a significant amount particularly when using the ResNet structure.	O	O	Review	20231
A somehow surprising message is, however, that if one imposes explicit regularization with rugosity in lieu of data augmentation, then the better generalization usually seen from data augmentation no longer presents, though one does get a network with smaller rugosity.	O	O	Review	20231
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Comments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]It is quite interesting to see that the rugosity measure proposed in the paper captures at least some aspects of the implicit regularization effect of data augmentation both in terms of theory (i.e. Theorem 1) and practical observations.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20231
My feeling is that rugosity is mostly a measure of the smoothness of the function parametrized by the neural network.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20231
From that perspective, how is the rugosity as a smoothness measurement for neural networks with piecewise affine activations different from the Lipschitz constant for general neural networks?	I-Review	I-1	Review	20231
My guess is that data augmentation also decreases the Lipschitz constant of a neural network near the training data points, but regardless of whether this is true or not, it is not clear if and how rugosity is better than Lipschitz constant for characterizing the implicit regularization of data augmentation.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20231
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In addition, there have been many recent studies on showing that gradient penalty / Lipschitz regularization are useful for achieving better generalization and adversarial robustness, see e.g. [a,b,c]. The results in this paper on showing that regularizing rugosity does not improve accuracy seem to contradict with the conclusion of these prior studies.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20231
It is unclear to me whether this is caused by insufficient experimentation or if there is any fundamental difference between rugosity and Lipschitz regularization that I am missing.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20231

[line_break_token][line_break_token]1&gt; How is the rugosity as a smoothness measurement for neural networks with piecewise affine activations different from the Lipschitz constant for general neural networks?	O	O	Reply	20231
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Two main features of our measure distinguish it from the Lipschitz constant: 1) Rugosity depends on the Hessian of the function generated by the deep network, which is a second-order smoothness measure.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20231
[line_break_token]In contrast, the Lipschitz constant is a first-order measure that depends on the first derivative (Jacobian) of the network.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20231
In other words, rugosity quantifies how much the function generated by a deep network differs from an affine mapping over the input space.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20231
We believe rugosity provides a better measure for complexity, especially when the network consists of continuous piecewise linear activations that result in a continuous piecewise linear prediction function.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20231
2) In many applications, for example when the input data consists of natural images, the training data points lie on a lower-dimensional manifold of dimension.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20231
We can exploit this local geometrical structure to evaluate the prediction mapping as a function of the manifold local coordinates and compute the rugosity on the data manifold.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20231
This result is a natural data-driven complexity measure for that evaluates its complexity over the signal space of importance.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20231
In contrast, the standard Lipschitz constant considers the entire input space, which might be not relevant.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20231
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In addition, as we demonstrate through our empirical results in Section 4.1 and Table 1, for classification tasks on the CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets, rugosity better reflects the difference between training with and without data augmentation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20231
Table 1 shows that data augmentation reduces when used for training on these datasets but has no effect (or increases) the Jacobian measure.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20231

This paper investigates the hessian of small deep networks near the end of training.	O	O	Review	478

The authors study in particular, the eigenspectrum of the Hessian, which relates to the difficulty and the local convexity of the optimization problem.	O	O	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While there are several interesting insights discussed in this paper such as the local flatness of the objective function, as well as the study of the relation between data distribution and Hessian, a somewhat lacking aspect of the paper is that most described effects are presented as general, while tested only in a specific setting, without control experiments, or mathematical analysis.	O	O	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For example, regarding the concentration of eigenvalues to zero in Figure 6, it is unclear whether the concentration effect is really caused by training (e.g. increasing insensitivity to local perturbations), or the consequence of a specific choice of scale for the initial parameters.	B-Review	B-1	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In Figure 8, the complexity of the data is not defined.	B-Review	B-2	Review	478
It is not clear whether two fully overlapping distributions (the Hessian would then become zero?)	I-Review	I-2	Review	478
is considered as complex or simple data.	I-Review	I-2	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Some of the plots legends (Fig.	B-Review	B-3	Review	478
1 and 2) and labels are unreadable in printed format.	I-Review	I-3	Review	478
Plots of Figure 3 don't have the same range for the x-axis.	I-Review	I-3	Review	478
The image of Hessian matrix of Figure 1 does not render properly in printed format.	I-Review	I-3	Review	478
We realized that the text hasn't been clear in the experiments that we performed.	O	O	Reply	478
We clarified the text.	O	O	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Figure 1 and figure 2 (left) show the beginning and the end of the model with 10-hidden units which is consistent with figure 6.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	478
In both cases of the simple data and MNIST the initial point is chosen randomly on the surface of a sphere centered at zero with fixed  radius (the radius is depends on the number of hidden units).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The complexity of data can be tricky to describe, a data can be more complex for a certain model but less so for another one.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	478
Thank you for pointing this out, we clarified this point on the data complexity by the ease of separability in the text.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]We also updated the axes and labels in fig 1 and 2.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	478
We changed the rendering format for the Hessian matrix increasing the sharpness and resolution.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	478
For figure 4 we would like to emphesize the two components of the spectrum, therefore we picked the widest possible representation for each case separately.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	478
However, we would also like to note that another series of experiments will explore the scale of eigenvalues depending on the iteration number during the training	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	478

The work presents some empirical observations to support the statement that ‚Äúthe Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate‚Äù.	B-Review	B-1	Review	478
But what does this statement refer to?	I-Review	I-1	Review	478
To my understanding, there are at least three interpretations:[line_break_token][line_break_token](i) The Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate at any point in the parameter space, i.e., any network weight matrices.	I-Review	I-1	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token](ii) The Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate at any critical point.	I-Review	I-1	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token](iii) The Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate at any local minimum, or any global minimum.	I-Review	I-1	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]None of these interpretations is solidly supported by the observations provided in the paper.	I-Review	I-1	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]More comments are as follows:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) The authors state that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have much information on what the actual Hessian looks like.	B-Review	B-2	Review	478
‚Äù Then I just wonder what Hessian is investigated.	I-Review	I-2	Review	478
Is it the actual one or approximate one?	I-Review	I-2	Review	478
Please clarify and provide the references for computing the actual Hessian.	I-Review	I-2	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) It is not clear whether the optimization was done by a batch gradient descent algorithm, i.e., batch back propagation (BP) algorithm, or a stochastic BP algorithm.	B-Review	B-3	Review	478
If the training was done via a stochastic BP algorithm, it is hard to conclude that the the Neural Network has been trained to its local minimum.	I-Review	I-3	Review	478
When it was done by a full-batch BP algorithm, what was the accumulating point?	I-Review	I-3	Review	478
Was it local minimum or global minimum?	I-Review	I-3	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) Since the negative log likelihood function was used as at the end of training, it is essentially a joint learning approach in both the Newton weight matrices and the negative log likelihood vector.	B-Review	B-4	Review	478
Certainly, the whole loss function is not convex in these two parameters.	I-Review	I-4	Review	478
But if least squares error function is used at the end, would it make any difference in claiming the degeneracy of the Hessian?	I-Review	I-4	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4) Finally, the statement ‚ÄúThere are still negative eigenvalues even when they are small in magnitude‚Äù is very puzzling.	B-Review	B-5	Review	478
Potential reasons are:[line_break_token](a) If the training algorithm did converge, the accumulating points were not local minima, i.e., they were saddle points.	I-Review	I-5	Review	478
[line_break_token](b) Training algorithms did not converge, or have not converged yet.	I-Review	I-5	Review	478
[line_break_token](c) The calculation of the actual Hessian might be inaccurate.	I-Review	I-5	Review	478
Clearly, we can't say that the Hessian of the loss function is degenerate everywhere in this empirical study in which we don't attempt to check all the points in theoretical or empirical ways.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	478
What we can say, however, is that the Hessian of the loss function is degenerate at the point where training begins and ends.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
This is indeed the body of our work.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
Moreover, we can presume the statement will be valid for the intermediate points over the course of the training, as well.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
We clarified this further in the text.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) The actual one that is computed through the Hessian vector product using Lop: Barak A. Pearlmutter, ‚ÄúFast Exact Multiplication by the Hessian‚Äù, Neural Computation, 1994, -we added the reference in the text. (	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	478
Also the approximate Hessian gives similar results.)	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) We use gradient descent (the batch method, when the minibatch size is equal to the number of examples in the dataset) in our main expeirments.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	478
We revised the text to clarify this.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	478
The only exception is the line interpolation that is presented in the conclusion which compares GD and SGD.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	478
However, we would like to note that the network is *not* trained to its local minimum.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	478
We train the network for a long time even after the training cost is stabilized.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	478
Yet, the norm of the gradient is typically at the order of 10^{-3}. It is pretty laborious to get a network that uses a log-loss to a level where the norm of the gradient is at the order of say 10^{-10} or lower.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	478
The basin that the point is in at the stopping time is, for all practical purposes, a local minimum (see ICLR 2015 Workshop, Explorations on high dimensional landscapes, Sagun et al).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3) Thank you for the suggestion!	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	478
Preliminary results with the mean square error also gives singular Hessian, pretty much in line with the observations laid out in our work.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	478
We added this new experiment in our work, as well.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4) The short answer is (b).	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	478
We included this in the previous bullet point, and we attempted to clarify it further.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	478
This point is actually one of the practical challenges in modern day deep learning.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	478
Pretty much none of the current models *converge* in the sense that they find a local minimum, the models stop way before it finds one, and for all practical purposes the point that did *not* converge doesn't perform any worse when one keeps training the model until it finds a point where the norm of the gradient is zero within the numerical accuracy.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	478
As references in the paper, there are reasons for GD to converge to a point where its Hessian has only non-negative eigenvalues.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	478
From a practical point of view, reaching stability in this dynamics would take a long time.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	478
In our work, we focus on the points we can find in practice, the ones whose grad_norm is relatively small, so that the gradient doesn't give any substantial signal for the gradient based model to move in the weight space.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	478

Studying the Hessian in deep learning, the experiments in this paper suggest that the eigenvalue distribution is concentrated around zero and the non zero eigenvalues are related to the complexity of the input data.	O	O	Review	478
I find most of the discussions and experiments to be interesting and insightful.	O	O	Review	478
However, the current paper could be significantly improved.	O	O	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Quality:[line_break_token]It seems that the arguments in the paper could be enhanced by more effort and more comprehensive experiments.	O	O	Review	478
Performing some of the experiments discussed in the conclusion could certainly help a lot.	O	O	Review	478
Some other suggestions:[line_break_token]1- It would be very helpful to add other plots showing the distribution of eigenvalues for some other machine learning method for the purpose of comparison to deep learning.	B-Review	B-1	Review	478
[line_break_token]2- There are some issues about the scaling of the weights and it make sense to normalize the weights each time before calculating the Hessian otherwise the result might be misleading.	B-Review	B-2	Review	478
[line_break_token]3- It might worth trying to find a quantity that measures the singularity of Hessian because it is difficult to visually conclude something from the plots.	B-Review	B-3	Review	478
[line_break_token]4- Adding some plots for the Hessian during the optimization is definitely needed because we mostly care about the Hessian during the optimization not after the convergence.	B-Review	B-4	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Clarity:[line_break_token]1- There is no reference to figures in the main text which makes it confusing for the reading to know the context for each figure.	B-Review	B-5	Review	478
For example, when looking at Figure 1, it is not clear that the Hessian is calculated at the beginning of optimization or after convergence.	I-Review	I-5	Review	478
[line_break_token]2- The texts in the figures are very small and hard to read.	B-Review	B-6	Review	478
Thank you for the comments and the review.	O	O	Reply	478
Quantification of singularity is crucial but it may be tricky and even misleading given the degenerate structure, therefore we thought it would be equally important to lay out the observations first, and then as a separate work consider the quantification.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We revised the paper in an attempt to address most of the issues mentioned above and in other comments.	O	O	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Also, we will add a comparison with another ML method, very soon.	O	O	Reply	478

In this paper, the authors proposed to combine both NN-based NAS and Aging EVO to get the benefit of both world: good global and local sample efficiency.	O	O	Review	478
The main idea is to use Aging EVO algorithm to guide the overall search process, and a NN predicting the final performance is used to guide the mutation process.	O	O	Review	478
The combined EVO-NAS has showed consistent good performance over a range of tasks.	O	O	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, while the novelty of the paper is not exceptional, since it is a rather straightforward combination of two existing approaches, the end-results is promising.	B-Review	B-1	Review	478
I would like to see more in-depth analysis on the combined algorithm to validate authors' hypothesis on why EVO-NAS works better.	I-Review	I-1	Review	478
More detailed comments can be found below.	O	O	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	478
The experiment on the synthetic task is not very helpful, since the domain can be far apart from the real NAS applications.	B-Review	B-2	Review	478
One evidence is that the NN significantly outperform EVO in this task but not in the other tasks.	I-Review	I-2	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	478
In difficult tasks, the proposed EVO-NAS and the original Aging EVO are very close in the first few hundreds of trials, however, later the gap remains the same.	B-Review	B-3	Review	478
It would be interesting to see if we can eliminate the gap by adding the NN component in the middle of the Aging EVO experiment (e.g., at the point of 2000 trials).	I-Review	I-3	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	O	O	Review	478
I am also curious about the difference between the NN learned from Neural agent vs. those learned from EVO-NAS agent.	B-Review	B-4	Review	478
Moreover, do we need a NN for the EVO-NAS?	I-Review	I-4	Review	478
Or something simpler would be sufficient to guide the search.	I-Review	I-4	Review	478
hank you for your comments and suggestions!	O	O	Reply	478
Please let us know if you have any more feedback about our work, since we would be happy to use it to make the paper better.	O	O	Reply	478
Below we specifically address each of the points that you made.	O	O	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Reply	478
We agree that the synthetic task is far from real NAS applications.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	478
In our paper we do focus on NAS, and the other lines of experiments (NAS-Bench, NLP datasets, ImageNet) are all real-life architecture search scenarios.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
However, as we hint in the ‚ÄúConclusion‚Äù section, it is possible to apply Evo-NAS to tasks outside of architecture search.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
Discrete optimization problems such as our toy task could be one example, and we see that Evo-NAS also performs very well in this domain.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
We think that makes the approach even more promising in terms of inspiring future work.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Reply	478
As we understand the proposal, you would consider running the NN learning component not from the beginning of the experiment, but start learning later on.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	478
This would save some computational cost; are we missing any other advantages of this approach?	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	478
Our initial intuition is that the savings might be limited due to low overhead of running the NN compared to the training of candidate architectures.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	478
However, it would be interesting to experiment further in this direction in the future.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	O	O	Reply	478
You made a good point that we could use something simpler than a Neural Network for the learning part of Evo-NAS.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	478
Since we wanted our approach to be comparable to existing methods, we used a NN, since it‚Äôs somewhat standard in the NAS community.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	478
Also, from a theoretical standpoint, a NN has a useful property of being a universal approximator.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	478
On the other hand, it does seem likely that guiding the evolutionary search (i.e. producing a good prior over mutations) might be an easier problem than learning the structure of all solutions (i.e. producing a good prior over the entire search space).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Therefore, it‚Äôs certainly possible that using something simpler as the learning part of Evo-NAS would be sufficient to get good results.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	478
However, again note that in terms of computational cost the NN part is negligible - so any gains would not be in terms of compute, but perhaps in enhanced explainability of the learning component	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	478

This paper is well organized.	O	O	Review	478
The applied methods are introduced in detail.	O	O	Review	478
But it lacks some more detailed analysis.	O	O	Review	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My concerns are as follows.	O	O	Review	478
[line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	478
The performance differences between Evolutionary agent and EVO-NAS agent seem not significant.	B-Review	B-1	Review	478
Please conduct additional statistical tests such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to verify the performance improvements are significant.	I-Review	I-1	Review	478
[line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	478
Many studies have been conducted to automatically adjust control parameters such as crossover and mutation probabilities in evolutionary algorithm literature.	B-Review	B-2	Review	478
It would be better to compare one of these approaches in the experiments.	I-Review	I-2	Review	478
hank you for your review!	O	O	Reply	478
We address each of your concerns below.	O	O	Reply	478
Please let us know if you have some further comments - we are happy to make changes to the paper to improve it.	O	O	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Reply	478
While the gains are not enormous, we agree with Reviewer #2 in saying that they are consistent across a range of different tasks: both in real-life AS scenarios (NAS-Bench, NLP, ImageNet), and in the synthetic task.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	478
However, making sure that differences between results are statistically significant is certainly an important point.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For example, note that for NLP (Table 1), we ran 10 runs for each (approach, dataset) pair.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
We claim that Evo-NAS matches the better of the baselines in all cases, and in 3 out of 7 it outperforms the best baseline with statistical significance.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
We made this claim for the three datasets where the difference exceeded twice the standard-error-of-the-mean.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
This can also be easily translated into p-values: for example, for the ConsumerComplaints dataset, the p-value for Evo-NAS‚Äôs gains over either baseline being statistically significant is &lt; 0.02 (so we reject the null hypothesis that there is no gain).	O	O	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We used simple statistical measures such as the ones described above to assess significance.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	478
However, we are open to performing additional nonparametric tests, such as the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test you proposed.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
Please let us know what would be the exact test that you had in mind (i.e. what would be the null hypothesis).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
For example, we could consider pairs of (average result of Evolution, average result of Evo-NAS) over all benchmarks considered in the paper (there are 10 in total since we should count each NLP dataset separately), and perform the test on these pairs.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
In that case, the Signed-Rank test does show significance, as in all cases the mean result of Evo-NAS is strictly better than the mean result of Evolution.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Reply	478
You are right in saying that there are many smart evolutionary algorithms out there.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	478
However, to our knowledge, the NAS domain is dominated by ‚Äúnon-adaptive‚Äù evolution (i.e. with uniform prior over mutations), which also seems to perform very well across different AS domains.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
Since here we focus on architecture search, we compare our method to two strong, common and most recent baselines (the combination of which gives Evo-NAS).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Note that our hybrid may not necessarily be the best algorithm of this kind; our intention was to show that combining these two worlds (learning-based and evolution-based) in a relatively simple way we can get consistent gains across multiple domains.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]One kind of follow-up works that we wish to inspire is exactly what you are proposing: bringing different ‚Äúsmart‚Äù genetic algorithms from the evolution community to the NAS community, and investigating their behavior on architecture search.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
It is surely an exciting direction, although one that is not the focus of our current work	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478

It is a nice paper that combines the deep reinforcement learning and evolutionary learning techniques to neural architecture search problem.	O	O	Review	478

[line_break_token]1.In Fig 1,2 &amp;3, it seems that the performances of Neural (PQT) keeps increasing.	O	O	Review	478
For better compassion, we recommend the authors reports the performances of compared algorithms until they are convergent.	B-Review	B-1	Review	478

[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Reply	478
To make the assessment that the methods have converged, we looked at the best reward attained (right plots), not reward running average (left plots).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	478
By ‚Äúreward running average‚Äù, we mean sliding a constant size window over the reward, and computing the average reward in each such window.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
This measure is not a good metric to compare the algorithms, and we use it just to show how much the reward varies from sample to sample for different methods.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Note that learning-based methods (like Neural PQT which you mentioned) do see small improvements in running average reward even long after they stop exploring new parts of the search space - this is simply because they keep making their distributions over actions ‚Äúsharper‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
Therefore, it is more informative to look at best reward attained over time.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]With that in mind, we review below the experiments that you pointed to - that is, Figures 2 and 3.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
You also mentioned Figure 1, which does not correspond to any experiment, so we assumed this to be a typo - but let us know if you meant something else there, and we can discuss further.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- For NAS-Bench (Figure 3), the methods see only marginal improvements at the end of the experiment.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- For the synthetic task (Figure 2), all methods see small improvements of the reward if ran longer, but the overall pattern remains the same (Evo-NAS (PQT) attaining the best results, matched by Neural (PQT) from around 4500 trials onward).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Reply	478
Our understanding is that PQT provides a stronger training signal than Reinforce.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	478
This comes at a cost, since Reinforce is known to be unbiased, and therefore it produces gradients that (in expectation) match the gradient of the expected reward.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
On the other hand, PQT is a heuristic, and it gives no theoretical guarantees.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We wouldn‚Äôt say that PQT is always better than Reinforce - this is likely very domain dependent.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
Our focus is architecture search, where the number of trials is typically low given the complexity of the search spaces.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
In this domain, as seen in our experiments, trading off theoretical guarantees and lack of bias for a stronger and more greedy training signal leads to better results.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Nevertheless, comparing PQT to classical RL algorithms (like Reinforce, but also many others) is a very interesting research direction.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478
Since our main goal was hybridizing RL-based and Evolution-based approaches to architecture search, we did not explore this direction in our work	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	478

The authors present an empirical study to evaluate the performance of CNN-based object classifiers for situations in which the object of interest is very small relative to the size of the image.	O	O	Review	209
Two artificial datasets, based on MNIST and histopathological images are introduced to conduct the experiments.	O	O	Review	209
Through empirical evaluation the authors conclude that the size of the dataset required for generalization increases rapidly with the inverse of the O2I ratio, that higher capacity models generalize better, and that accounting for the model's receptive field is key.	O	O	Review	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The contributions of the study are limited: i) The artificial datasets generate images that are small and O2Is that are big for the applications of interest, e.g., gigapixels images in digital pathology (see Figure 1).	B-Review	B-1	Review	209
ii) The dataset based on MNIST is perhaps too artificial (too structured), once one compares their results relative to nCAMELYON.	B-Review	B-2	Review	209

However, before addressing the individual concerns we would like to revisit the main points of the paper and highlight our contributions: (1) We identified an unexplored machine learning problem of image classification in low and very low signal-to-noise ratios; this problem has not been discussed in the past and the community seems unaware of it; we feel this as an important contribution as proposing a new method or theory; (2) We carefully designed two image datasets with controlled signal-to-noise ratios and highlighted that CNNs struggle to show good generalization for low and very low signal-to-noise ratios even for a relatively elementary MNIST-based dataset; (3) we ran an extensive series of controlled experiments that explore both a variety of CNNs' architectural choices and the importance of training data scale for the low and very low signal-to-noise classification.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first, large scale empirical demonstration of optimization and generalization problems of CNNs with very low signal-to-noise classification scenarios.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	209

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Below, we address the reviewer‚Äôs concerns.	O	O	Reply	209
[line_break_token]i) We use Figure 1 as a motivational example to illustrate the need for an in depth study of low signal-to-noise classification scenarios.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	209
We run our study on the range of O2I ratios that varies from 0.075% (7e-4) and 19.14% (2e-1), thus, we cover the whole range of MiniMIAS dataset and a significant portion of CAMELYON17 dataset.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	209
Since we already observed interesting trends as well as optimization and generalization difficulties in the lower spectrum of the tested range, we did not include the O2I range of [10e-6, 7e-4] as it will show similar results to 0.075%.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	209
Moreover, the scope of the study is to explore the optimization and the generalization properties of CNN as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and not image resolution.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	209
Nevertheless, our testbed can easily be extended to more challenging O2I ratios and image resolutions.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token]ii) We would argue that there is a value in showing current methods‚Äô limitations in a simple, large scale dataset such as nMNIST.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	209
In a series of controlled experiments, we show that even such elementary dataset is very challenging for current CNN architectures.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token]iii) We explore 48 different variants of ResNets (3 receptive field sizes, 4 different pooling operations and 4 different model capacities - please refer to section B in the supplementary material for the details about the tested model architectures).	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	209
We decided to use ResNet-like backbones due to its versatility in a variety of computer vision tasks.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	209
These networks have shown very good results in tasks such as image classification and were proven to be very effective backbones in tasks such as object detection and image segmentation.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	209

For details about pooling operations considered in our study, please see section B1 of the supplementary material.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token]v) While the question of detection multiple ‚Äò3‚Äôs in a single image is an interesting one, the nMNIST dataset was designed to highlight the limitations of current CNN in a clean and straightforward way‚Äî we wanted to showcase an elementary scenario in which current CNN encounter generalization problems when faced with low and very low signal-to-noise scenarios.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]I believe that the question the authors try to answer is very interesting and worth of exploration.	O	O	Review	209
However, I am a bit less excited about the achieved results since I consider them not to be sufficient to drive conclusions.	B-Review	B-1	Review	209
The experiments proposed by the authors are run on two different datasets created ad-hoc: the nMNIST and the nCAMELYON, both modifications of MNIST and CAMELYON datasets.	I-Review	I-1	Review	209
Over all the experiments run, the behaviors observed on the two datasets are not the same.	I-Review	I-1	Review	209
The explanation provided by the authors is that since nCAMELYON is very small, results are different from the ones of nMNIST.	I-Review	I-1	Review	209
While I consider this a valid explanation, this still limits the overall conclusions of this paper.	I-Review	I-1	Review	209
Therefore, my main recommendation to the authors would be to identify other datasets for their experiment.	I-Review	I-1	Review	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the dicussion section, the authors argue that MS COCO is not a good candidate since the background usually contains information that allows to infer the label.	B-Review	B-2	Review	209
I wonder if it would be possible to generate a new dataset, starting from MS COCO, that avoids this problem.	I-Review	I-2	Review	209
Using the example of the paper, I would argue that it is possible to obtain images of outdoors with people where there are no balls.	I-Review	I-2	Review	209
Having such a dataset would make your paper much stronger.	I-Review	I-2	Review	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally, to some extent, I consider that your problem is strongly linked to anomaly/detection detection.	B-Review	B-3	Review	209
In the end, this is what a needle in a haystack is.	I-Review	I-3	Review	209
How do you position yourselves with respect to the state of the art on this topic?	I-Review	I-3	Review	209
any thanks for the insightful comments and highlighting the interest in the problem that we aim to address.	O	O	Reply	209
Below we address the concerns of the reviewer:[line_break_token][line_break_token][inconclusive observations on two used datasets][line_break_token]This is indeed an important observation that motivates the need for low and very low signal-to-noise classification scenarios testbed and indicates that further research is required.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	209
We do not see this as a limitation of our paper, but rather an important aspect of the study.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	209
In this paper, we designed a testbed by including two dataset to showcase the limitation of current CNNs when working with low O2I ratios: 1) nMNIST dataset is an elementary, large scale dataset that highlights that even in relatively simple scenarios current CNNs fail to generalize well when faced with low signal-to-noise images; 2) nCAMELYON highlights how current methods behave when faced with probably the largest (although still small in machine learning terms), publicly available needle-in-a-haystack dataset.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	209
Finally, we would like to point out, that by opensourcing our testbed framework (that includes data preparation, model architectures and training scripts) we invite the community to contribute new challenging low and very low signal-to-noise classification datasets.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token][additional datasets][line_break_token]As mentioned in the discussion section, we initially considered other datasets to be a part of our study (including MS-COCO).	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	209
However, what the reviewer suggests is not straightforward at all, since the dataset does not contain an outdoor class it wouldn't be possible to automatically get a subset of images that contain people in outdoor without the ball (it would require additional human labeling).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	209
One possibility to overcome this issue might be to use another class label as an indication of outdoor class, for example, one could create the dataset for ball vs. no ball classification using a context of people and baseball bat.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	209
However, the size of such dataset would still be small (similarly to CAMELYON dataset).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	209
Nevertheless, we adapted the discussion section to suggest such an experiment as a future work.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token][connections to outlier detection][line_break_token]The low and very low signal-to-noise classification setup could potentially be framed as anomaly detection, e. g. one could use images without the object of interest to fit ‚Äúnormality‚Äù model and, then, use this model to detect regions with anomalies in an image.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	209
In this setup, one would expect that the anomaly would coincide with the object of interest (needle in a haystack).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	209
However, if approaching this problem in an ‚Äúunsupervised‚Äù way there is no guarantee that the anomaly would coincide with the object of interest.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	209
One way to overcome this issue is by incorporating the information about image-level labels (e. g. by merging outlier detection with classification).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	209
We would argue that when having access to image labels it is more natural to deal with this problem as low and very low signal-to-noise classification.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	209
Nevertheless, the idea of using anomaly based model inductive biases in CNNs is interesting and we leave it for future work.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	209

The submission proposes an analysis of the impact of object size in images when performing classification tasks using neural networks of the BagNet family.	O	O	Review	209
The analysis is performed on two datasets, a large resolution cluttered MNIST and a histopathology dataset named nCAMELYON.	O	O	Review	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper attack interesting questions and links the size of the object in the image (O2I) to the training dataset size required.	O	O	Review	209
Also, showing that max-pooling is the only pooling operation that converges for very low O2I (but is the slowest to converge at higher O2I) is interesting and encourages discussion about the training (optimization) process.	O	O	Review	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In my opinion, the main issue about the submission is the limited depth in the contributions, analyzing a single family of network architectures (BagNets) over two datasets, one of which is relatively small.	B-Review	B-1	Review	209
The family of R-CNN and its derivatives were especially designed to counter the impact of object size, it would have been interesting to include them in the analysis.	B-Review	B-5	Review	209
Furthermore, limited insights can be carried out for tasks related to classification such as localization and segmentation.	I-Review	I-5	Review	209
Models such as Single Shot Detectors split the image into grids and variable anchor sizes to perform their inference, are they affected to a lesser extent by object size?	I-Review	I-5	Review	209
The limited insights provided to potential future readers prevents me from recommending the submission for acceptance.	I-Review	I-5	Review	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token]On p. 7 (and fig.	B-Review	B-2	Review	209

I am not sure about this remark, I would have expected the network to learn to focus on the right regions, provided the receptive field is big enough to see the whole object of interest.	I-Review	I-2	Review	209

any thanks for dedicating time to review our paper.	O	O	Reply	209
We feel the reviewer is missing some important points of our study, which we would like to clarify below:[line_break_token][line_break_token][Depth of the contribution][line_break_token]We argue that the depth of our contribution is significant: the paper makes an important contribution by revealing a substantial limitation of current methods, and provides methodology (a testbed) to empirically study this limitation on two datasets.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	209
We would strongly argue that these contributions can help to advance the field, and should be considered as important as proposing a new method or theory.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	209
Moreover, the breadth of our analysis is substantial as for each dataset, we explored 48 different variants of ResNets (3 receptive field sizes, 4 different pooling operations and 4 different model capacities - please refer to section B in the supplementary material for the details about the tested model architectures).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	209
To ensure the robustness of our conclusions we ran more than 750 different hyperparamenter setups (each one run with 6 different random seeds).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	209
This is not a trivial empirical study, and the insights we can gain from it should be of interest to many in the community.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Suitability of object detection architectures e. g. R-CNN][line_break_token]R-CNN or SSD like architectures were built to tackle object detection problems, whereas we are interested in image classification problem.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	209
In object detection, one would require access to localized labels such as pixel level annotations in the form of bounding box information.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	209
Such annotations are not available in many important real-world applications, and hence R-CNN type methods are not applicable.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	209
Moreover, if bounding box annotations were available one could easily translate the low signal-to-noise classification problem into an imbalanced classification problem (with small number of positive classes and large number of negative classes) ‚Äî as it is done in object detection approaches.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	209
Therefore, we argue that the problem we are studying in this paper is very different, but equally relevant, from the object detection setup and has different challenges which make object detection pipelines not applicable to our setup.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token][fig.	O	O	Reply	209
7 (b)][line_break_token]When designing our experiments we ensured fixed model capacity by increasing the number of filters for the networks with lower receptive fields (see Table 3 in the appendix).	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	209
Therefore, all models have similar capacity (unless specifically stated).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	209
We agree with the reviewer, that when having access to large dataset one should observe good results for all receptive field sizes that are bigger than the size of an object of interest (as confirmed by our results on nMNIST).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	209
However, when dataset is relatively small (such as nCAMELYON), we observe that the small receptive field tends to generalize better.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	209
We attribute this to the fact that within a larger receptive field there are more spurious correlations (more random patterns might look like a class-discriminative ones), as a result the model with larger receptive field overfits.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	209
We clarified this in the manuscript.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	209
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Digits overlap][line_break_token]Although restricting the digits‚Äô overlap might clarify the classification problem for humans, we argue that it is not affecting the generalization of CNNs in large O2I scenarios and as a result the digits‚Äô overlap is not affecting our conclusions.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	209
For example, we can observe that the tested models for an O2I ratios of 20% reach very good results (90%+ of test set accuracy) - suggesting that the digits‚Äô overlap does not impede good model generalization.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	209
Moreover, our qualitative results (shown in supplementary material) show that CNNs correctly classify images with overlapping digits (see Figures 16a, 16d, 16e, 16h, 16i, 16l, 16n) while making mistakes in images without any overlap (see Figure 16c).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	209
Thus, the change of O2I seem to affect the generalization way stronger than the digits‚Äô overlap.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	209

This paper explores the problem of deep heteroskedastic multivariate regression where the goal is to regress over symmetric positive definite matrices; that is, the deep learning model should take as input data points, and produce a conditional covariance matrix as the output.	O	O	Review	20521
The key challenge in this setting is how to ensure the predicted matrix is positive definite (and thus follows the non-linear geometry of these matrices), how the neural network can be trained for this task, and what loss function can be used for effective training.	O	O	Review	20521
The paper proposes a neural network with bilinear layers in this regard, and uses the von Neumann divergence as the loss function to regress the predicted covariance against a ground truth SPD matrix.	O	O	Review	20521
The gradients of the von Neumann divergence are provided for learning via backpropagation.	O	O	Review	20521
Experiments on several synthetic datasets and small scale datasets are provided, showcasing some benefits.	O	O	Review	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros: [line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	20521
The use of von Neumann divergence as a loss for this task is perhaps novel.	O	O	Review	20521
[line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	20521
The use of \alpha-derivatives, while computationally demanding, is perhaps novel in this context as well.	O	O	Review	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons:[line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	20521
I do not think the problem setting or the proposed framework is entirely new or is the best choice of its ingredients.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20521
Specifically, the idea of using second-order neural networks have been attempted in several prior papers, including the ones the paper cite (such as Ionescu et al ,2015).	I-Review	I-1	Review	20521
Several other papers in this regard are listed below.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20521
[line_break_token][a] Second-order Temporal pooling for action recognition, Cherian and Gould, IJCV, 2018[line_break_token][b] Deep manifold-to-manifold transforming network, Zhang et al, ICIP, 2018[line_break_token][c] Statistically motivated second-order pooling, Yu and Salzmann, ECCV, 2018[line_break_token][line_break_token]In comparison to these methods, it is not clear how the proposed setup is novel, or in what way is method better.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20521
There are no comparisons to these methods, and thus it is difficult to judge the benefits even empirically.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	20521
There are also models that predict the mean and covariance matrices directly from the model, such as the works below.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20521
The paper should also include and perhaps compare to their datasets.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20521
[line_break_token][d] Deep Inference for Covariance Estimation: Learning Gaussian Noise Models for State Estimation, Liu et al, ICRA, 2018[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	O	O	Review	20521
I do not think the use of von Neumann divergence as a loss is the best choice one could have, esp.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20521
for a deep neural network learning setting.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20521
This divergence includes the matrix logarithm, which is perhaps computationally expensive.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20521
This is a problem when using other popular loss/similarity functions on SPD matrices (such as the log-Euclidean metric).	I-Review	I-3	Review	20521
Perhaps a better option is to use the Jensen-Bregman log-det divergence, as suggested in [a] above; this divergence is symmetric and also has computationally efficient gradients.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20521
It is unclear why the paper decided to use von Neumann.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4.	O	O	Review	20521
The experiments are not compelling, there are no comparisons to alternative models and the datasets used are small scale.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20521
Thus, it is unclear if the design choices in the paper have any strong bearing in the empirical performances.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, the paper makes an attempt at designing neural networks for learning SPD matrices.	O	O	Review	20521
While, there are some components in the model that are perhaps new, the paper lacks any justifications for their choices, and as such these choices seem inferior to alternatives that have been proposed earlier.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20521
Also, the experimental results are not convincing against prior works.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20521

This manuscript proposes a novel formulation of the MLP to address predicting a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix from an input vector or matrix.	O	O	Review	20521
 While the field has had methods for years to estimate SPD matrices (such as the covariance matrix estimate in the reparameterization trick), this manuscript proposes a markedly different approach based on a different layer structure and repeated normalization steps based on Mercer Kernels.	O	O	Review	20521
 Additionally, the loss used can be modified to use more PSD-specific losses, such as the symmetrized von Neumann divergence, rather than the traditional quadratic loss.	O	O	Review	20521
 This loss appears to give significantly better solutions on synthetic data.	O	O	Review	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While there is some interesting and potentially useful novelty in the approach, I have some concerns about the empirical evidence and modeling to truly determine the mMLP's utility.	O	O	Review	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, in the synthetic data the mMLP with the l_QRE loss outperforms the l_quad loss with regards to both E_QRE and E_quad.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20521
 Why does mMLP/l_QRE outperform on E_quad?	I-Review	I-1	Review	20521
As l_quad is actually designed to minimize this error, this is surprising and needs additional explanation.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20521
 Additionally, there are two major changes between mMLP and the MLP.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20521
 One is the network structure, and the second is the trace being normalized; which change really induces the improvements in the performance?	I-Review	I-2	Review	20521
If the l_QRE loss was used in the MLP, would you get similar improvements?	I-Review	I-2	Review	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The network structure as a whole needs greater validation.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20521
 A major difference in (3) is that the weight matrices W_l are applied as a both a left and right multiplication.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20521
 Given that the \mathcal{H} operation symmetrizes and normalizes the matrix, a symmetric operation isn't strictly necessary here.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20521
 Using both multiplications leads to quadratic properties, which in my experience are less stable in the optimization.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20521
 Can the authors validate this structure versus the simpler structure of simply using left multiplications?	I-Review	I-3	Review	20521
 Or, in other words, is this weight multiplication structure helpful or do the benefits really come from the \mathcal{H} operation.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I think that the heteroscedastic regression experiments don't evaluate on one of the key issues, which is uncertainty estimation.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20521
 The trace-1 normalization is highly restrictive, so I imagine that that this method is getting the uncertainty incorrect.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20521
 Also, heteroscedastic regression has a long history in neural networks, dating back to at least Nix and Wiegand in 1994.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20521

gt;&gt; First, in the synthetic data the mMLP with the l_QRE loss outperforms the l_quad loss with regards to both E_QRE and E_quad.	O	O	Reply	20521
Why does mMLP/l_QRE outperform on E_quad?	O	O	Reply	20521
As l_quad is actually designed to minimize this error, this is surprising and needs additional explanation.	O	O	Reply	20521
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]Note that the evaluation is on the test set and not on the train set.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20521
When we use l_quad in mMLP, the generalization is poor on the test set.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20521
So it is very much expected from mMLP/l_QRE to outperform on E_QRE, E_quad and in fact any other relevant metric.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20521
This highlights that the mMLP/l_QRE has a good generalization on the test set which is really what matters.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]&gt;&gt; Additionally, there are two major changes between mMLP and the MLP.	O	O	Reply	20521
 One is the network structure, and the second is the trace being normalized; which change really induces the improvements in the performance?	O	O	Reply	20521
If the l_QRE loss was used in the MLP, would you get similar improvements?	O	O	Reply	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We used l_QRE in MLP in Section 5.1.3.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20521
Table 2 shows the result of the evaluation.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20521
The result showed that MLP benefits from l_QRE but still under-performs in comparison to the mMLP/l_QRE.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20521
That suggests both the loss and the architecture are important.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]&gt;&gt; The network structure as a whole needs greater validation.	O	O	Reply	20521
A major difference in (3) is that the weight matrices W_l are applied as a both a left and right multiplication.	O	O	Reply	20521
 Given that the \mathcal{H} operation symmetrizes and normalizes the matrix, a symmetric operation isn't strictly necessary here.	O	O	Reply	20521
 Using both multiplications leads to quadratic properties, which in my experience are less stable in the optimization.	O	O	Reply	20521
 Can the authors validate this structure versus the simpler structure of simply using left multiplications?	O	O	Reply	20521
 Or, in other words, is this weight multiplication structure helpful or do the benefits really come from the \mathcal{H} operation.	O	O	Reply	20521
[line_break_token][line_break_token]What you are suggesting is similar to the experiment that we carried out in Section 5.1.3.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20521

[line_break_token][line_break_token]&gt;&gt; I think that the heteroscedastic regression experiments don't evaluate on one of the key issues, which is uncertainty estimation.	O	O	Reply	20521
The trace-1 normalization is highly restrictive, so I...[line_break_token][line_break_token]There is a misunderstanding here.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	20521
Please take a second look at equation (16) and (17).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20521
As you can see the information about the trace is all captured by the scale parameter \eta.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20521
That means for the Gaussian case in (16), the Var[y|X] is \eta\Omega where \omega is a trace-1 matrix and \eta includes the trace term.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20521
This is stated in the line below equation (16) and below equation (17).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20521
So we are indeed learning the full covariance including the trace term.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20521
We are basically learning the full covariance as two individual terms: trace term \eta and trace-1 matrix \Omega.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20521
The model should capture uncertainties just as expected and trace-1 normalization imposes no restriction since, in addition to the trace-one matrix \omega, we are also learning its normalization \eta.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20521

This was stated in the abstract and empirically validated throughout the paper.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	20521

For both methods, we used Adam as the optimizer, and considered scheduling of the learning rate.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	20521
We experimented with various batch sizes, and found that in both cases smaller batch-sizes are preferred though the results are not sensitive to the tuning of this hyperparameter.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	20521
For the NBCR, the key tuning parameter with the most effect was the truncation.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	20521
We tried different values ranging from 5 to 20 (step size of 5).	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	20521
In general, due to the need for sampling, the tuning of the NBCR is quite time-consuming.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	20521

This paper investigates the question of internal consistency in emergent communication.	O	O	Review	617
In other words, the paper aims to answer the question ‚Äòhow is emergent communication improved if we enforce the constraint that an agent must speak in the same way that it listens?‚Äô The paper explores three methods of enforcing internal consistency: self-play, shared embeddings, and symmetric encoding/decoding.	O	O	Review	617
They find that, while internal consistency does not help generalization to unseen objects, it does allow agents to generalize over conversational roles (i.e. to perform well as a speaker despite only being trained as a listener).	O	O	Review	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I have been eagerly anticipating a paper on this topic ‚Äì it seems silly that the listening and speaking modules in traditional emergent communication research are completely disjoint.	O	O	Review	617
I think coming up with methods/ architectures that combine these two capabilities is an important research direction.	O	O	Review	617
I also think paper is very well-written and structured, and it reads very well.	O	O	Review	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]However, I have several concerns with the paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	617
First, half of the results center around the hypothesis ‚Äòinternal consistency helps agents generalize to unseen items‚Äô.	I-Review	I-1	Review	617
While ultimately this hypothesis is disproven, it‚Äôs unclear as to why this might be expected in the first place.	I-Review	I-1	Review	617
The only justification of this hypothesis I could find in the paper is the sentence ‚ÄúIt is conceivable that &lt;internal consistency&gt; might improve performance even though each &lt;agent&gt; remains in a fixed role.	O	O	Review	617
‚Äù In my view, the fact that this hypothesis is ‚Äòconceivable‚Äô is a rather weak argument for it to be such a prominent part of the paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	617
Thus, I don‚Äôt think this half of the results add much to the overall paper.	I-Review	I-1	Review	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I also have mixed feelings about the use of ‚Äòself-play‚Äô to enforce internal consistency, and how it relates to the core result of the paper: ‚Äúthe proposed constraints enable models to generalize learned language representations across communicative roles, even in the case of where the agent receives no direct training in the target (test) role‚Äù.	B-Review	B-7	Review	617
In short, I think the phrase ‚Äúno direct training‚Äù is misleading, as the self-play itself is almost a form of direct training, and thus the result isn‚Äôt very surprising.	I-Review	I-7	Review	617
 [line_break_token][line_break_token] More specifically, each agent ‚ÄòAlice and Bob‚Äô are composed of two modules: a speaking module and a listening module.	B-Review	B-2	Review	617
During normal training (say, in the shape environment), Alice speaks and Bob listens (achieving a reward if Bob selects the right shape, which is backpropagated to Alice), and thus the Alice‚Äôs speaker module and Bob‚Äôs listener module are updated.	I-Review	I-2	Review	617
Alice‚Äôs listening capabilities will be equivalent to a random agent, as her listening module is still randomly initialized.	I-Review	I-2	Review	617
Now, during self-play, Alice‚Äôs speaker module is trained with her listener module (I believe in the same way as it is trained with Bob‚Äôs listener module) to achieve high reward.	I-Review	I-2	Review	617
This listener module is then tested against Bob‚Äôs speaker module (which is also trained via self-play).	I-Review	I-2	Review	617
To me, this process isn‚Äôt the same as the paper‚Äôs narrative of ‚Äòwe only train Alice to be a speaker, and she learns to listen!‚Äô This is especially true since, without parameter tying, the choice of saying that listener module ‚Äòbelongs to Alice‚Äô is arbitrary (since it‚Äôs completely separate).	I-Review	I-2	Review	617
An equivalent way of framing this result would be ‚Äúlanguage learning is transitive: if we train agent A to speak to agent B who listens, then train agent C to listen to agent A and agent D to speak to agent B, then agents D can perform well with agent C‚Äù.	I-Review	I-2	Review	617
With this framing, the result is much less surprising (in fact, it would be surprising if this weren‚Äôt true).	I-Review	I-2	Review	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally, the three methods of enforcing internal consistency are not tested independently --- shared embeddings are only tested on top of self-play, and symmetric encoding/decoding is only tested on top of the other two.	B-Review	B-3	Review	617
While this does make the paper more concise, I suspect another reason for this is that the self-play is the core driver of performance, and without it the other two methods don‚Äôt do much.	I-Review	I-3	Review	617
I‚Äôd like this to be explained more explicitly in the paper.	I-Review	I-3	Review	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, I really like the problem the paper is tackling, however I have some issues with the framing of the paper in relation to the self-play constraint, and subsequently with the importance of the results.	B-Review	B-7	Review	617
Thus, I do not recommend acceptance in the paper‚Äôs current form.	I-Review	I-7	Review	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Questions:[line_break_token]-[tab_token]‚ÄúWe set shared embedding agents to always use the self-play objective, because otherwise its equivalent to the baseline agent‚Äù -&gt; it‚Äôs not clear to me why this is the case.	O	O	Review	617

[line_break_token][line_break_token]* What is the motivation for the hypothesis that internal consistency will improve generalization to unseen items?	O	O	Reply	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]You raised concerns that our first hypothesis (internal consistency can improve generalization to unseen items) is not well motivated.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	617
We disagree.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	617
Our initial motivation for this line of work was based largely on evidence from developmental psychology which suggests that pragmatic reasoning may encourage children to develop ‚Äúone-to-one‚Äù mappings between words and referents (see e.g. [1]).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	617
These types of one-to-one lexicons are what we want to see agents learn in emergent settings, and is often what is actually meant when people use words like ‚Äúcompositional‚Äù or ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù in other similar EC work.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	617
We deliberately chose *not* to lean on the psychological motivation in this paper because we believe that, presently, the ML field is a bit too quick to try to connect the models we build to arguments about ‚Äúhow the brain works‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	617
We are happy to draw inspiration from evidence in psychology and believe others absolutely should too.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	617
But we prefer to minimize the risk that papers are misread as evidence for/against a hypothesis about human language acquisition unless the experiment is in fact designed precisely to test psychological theories.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	617
Thus, we chose to take a more conservative approach to our framing by letting the ML hypotheses speak for themselves, rather than frame them as somehow entwined with hypotheses about human language acquisition.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	617
We still believe that this was the appropriate choice, but hope you can see that the hypothesis was in fact motivated, not pulled out of thin air.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	617
We rephrased the first paragraph of Section 5.1.3 to provide a bit more motivation, though still without pulling in psych arguments.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	617
We hope you are happier with this wording.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	617

[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]* Why are shared embeddings and symmetric (de)encoders not tested in isolation?	O	O	Reply	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We now think our presentation, and perhaps terminology, are not sufficiently clear.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Both shared embedding and symmetric decoders/encoders are instances of parameter-tying.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
Note that parameter-tying only matters if the agents use these tied parameters.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
So, if the agents only ever train/test in a signal role, then the weights tied between roles have no impact.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
Therefore ‚Äúwe set shared embedding agents to always use the self-play objective‚Äù because otherwise the ‚Äúconstrained‚Äù model would be no different from the baseline model.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We realize that this is not the case in a wider range of experimental setups (that go beyond the scope of our paper): for example, if the agents were set to both speak and listen to each other, then indeed there would be a distinction.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
This setup somewhat occurs in our experiment on role generalization where Alice listens to Bob on ‚Äúshapes 1‚Äù, Alice speaks to Bob on ‚Äúshapes 2‚Äù, and then is tested on speaking to Bob on ‚Äúshapes 1‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
However, as we noted without self-play all methods achieve poor performance in role generalization, and we now highlight this in the report.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Are we going beyond determining if language learning is transitive?	O	O	Reply	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In light of the previous question, it is not the same because we evaluate if parameter-tying impacts the result.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	617
Thus, with this framing in mind, we are investigating if there is any interplay between self-play and parameter-tying that goes beyond transitive language learning.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	617
It appears, especially for role generalization, internal consistency constraints (self-play + parameter-tying) go beyond transitive language learning in many cases.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	617
In any case, it‚Äôs not evident (without our evaluation) that the protocols would not drift between roles/agents.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Further updates[line_break_token]- We tried to highlight that ‚Äúdirect supervision‚Äù refers to interaction between the agents evaluated at test time.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	617
We found it apt because the other interaction (self-play) is auxiliary, and from the perspective of the final task it is unsupervised.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	617
[line_break_token]- Yes, the final row of table 4 should be labeled ‚ÄúTrans, shapes‚Äù ‚Äî thank you, we fixed this in our revised report.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	617

The paper analyzes if enforcing internal-consistency for speaker-listener setup can (i) improve the ability of the agents to refer to unseen referents (ii) generalize for different communicative roles.	O	O	Review	617
The paper evaluates a transformer and arecurrent model modified with various sharing strategies on a single-turn reference game.	O	O	Review	617
Finally, the paper claims that results with self-play suggest that internal consistency doesn‚Äôt help (i) but improves cross-role performance for (ii).	O	O	Review	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As a reader, the paper doesn‚Äôt provide me a concrete finding which can help in designing future multi-agent systems.	B-Review	B-3	Review	617
Most of the results for the experiments (except self-play) don‚Äôt have a uniform signal across the board to deduce whether the internal-consistency works in all of the cases.	I-Review	I-3	Review	617
Most of the speaker-listener scenarios emerge in dialog based settings which are multi-turn and require agents to act both as speaker and listener.	I-Review	I-3	Review	617
Though paper advocates through some of its results that self-play is helpful in generalization across roles via internal-consistency, without multi-step experiments, qualitative and quantitative analysis of what is happening and why there is so much variation, the paper is weak in its current form.	I-Review	I-3	Review	617
Therefore, I recommend weak reject as my rating.	I-Review	I-3	Review	617
Below I discuss some of the concerns in detail:[line_break_token][line_break_token]Without multi-step evaluation, it is hard to gauge the extent to which self-play for internal consistency help in generalization of the roles.	I-Review	I-3	Review	617
For e.g., task from Das et al (2017) [1] provides a clear signal on how well the agents are able to communicate through dialog evaluation.	I-Review	I-3	Review	617
So in 5.2.1, the setup which requires training in both roles can provide better signal overall if it was trained to do multi-step conversation.	I-Review	I-3	Review	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Paper is missing any kind of quantitative or qualitative analysis.	B-Review	B-1	Review	617
What are the differences between the embeddings of the agent that learned via self-play and the one which learned directly.	I-Review	I-1	Review	617
It also be interesting to see how the shared embeddings and symmetric encoding and decoding affect these embedding and might help explain the drop and randomness.	I-Review	I-1	Review	617
In Table 4.,	I-Review	I-1	Review	617
the results on symmetric encoding suggest that the claim of generalization through internal consistency might not hold everywhere.	I-Review	I-1	Review	617
For Shared Embedding results, on RNN shapes, it is surprising that training in one role improves performance through internal consistency while in both roles it drops.	B-Review	B-2	Review	617
These require further analysis to solidify the claim.	I-Review	I-2	Review	617
Given the flaky results, to boost the claim, have authors tried other settings to test internal-consistency like Predator-Prey?	I-Review	I-2	Review	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Things that didn‚Äôt affect the score:[line_break_token][line_break_token]Related work section is missing the relevant discussion on continuous communication work and discussion on why internal consistency wasn‚Äôt tested on those settings as well.

Currently, the only take-away is that self-play helps in generalizing to listener roles as well.	O	O	Review	617
For the other negative insight that internal consistency doesn't help with generalization, as R2 suggested, it is unclear why that would be case in the first place (I read the pscyhology arguments, but I am not still not convinced).	B-Review	B-2	Review	617

[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Why no multi-step communication?	O	O	Reply	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We understand your concern about not using multi-step communication as follows: the agents may behave similarly to agents that self-play if they had to act over multiple turns and correspondingly ‚Äî as part of the game itself ‚Äî both speak and listen.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]This is a great idea and may extend the range of the results.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
We‚Äôd love to pursue something along these lines in future work.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
As a starting point, we chose to focus on tasks like reference games, with an applied setting of instruction-following robots.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
In these contexts, there are often no follow ups to ‚Äúget me my coffee cup‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to buy that red sweatshirt‚Äù other than proffering the predicted item within the context.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
Given that real interactions with humans are expensive (much more so than self-play), it would be beneficial if learning agents could leverage pre-existing data and self-play in order generalize to untrained roles.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
We did not flesh out this viewpoint because this work does not fully extend into this setting, but your concerns suggest that we should have clarified this.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* What are the differences between the embeddings of the agent that learned via self-play and the one which learned directly? (	O	O	Reply	617
e.g more qualitative and quantitative analysis!)	O	O	Reply	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We did not heavily inspect the embeddings of the agents, however we did add a section (now Section 6) of additional qualitative and quantitative analysis that inspects the efficacy of selplay, the agents‚Äô communication, and finally, shows the lexicon the agent‚Äôs produced.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* For Shared Embedding results, on RNN shapes, it is surprising that training in one role improves performance through internal consistency while in both roles it drops.	O	O	Reply	617
Why?	O	O	Reply	617
[line_break_token][line_break_token]It appears that the additional signal does not provide useful information to the agents: perhaps the resultant protocols do not utilize the lexicon developed by the agents in the original role.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	617
This would be the case if there were a one-to-one mapping between features and symbols (or something like this).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	617

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The overall approach is interesting: all three of the key techniques (aux.	O	O	Review	335

I have assumed that "per-bout" refers to "per-action event", but now I am not certain that I have understood this correctly (i.e. can a "bout" last for a few minutes?):	I-Review	I-4	Review	335

[line_break_token][line_break_token]In response to comment about fly behaviours that last minutes vs milliseconds: This is interesting, and I would be curious to know how classification accuracy relates to the time-scale of the behaviour (e.g. are most of the mistakes on long-term behaviours?	B-Review	B-5	Review	335
i realize that this would only tell part of the story, e.g. if you have a behaviour that has both a long-term duration, but that also has very different short-term characteristics than many other behaviours, it should be easy to classify accuractely despite being "long-term").	I-Review	I-5	Review	335
If easy to investigate this, I would add a comment about it; if this is hard to investigate, it's probably not worth it at this point, although it's something you might want to look at in future.	I-Review	I-5	Review	335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In response to comment about scaling to human behavior: I agree that in principle, adding conv layers directly above the sensory input would be the right thing to try, but seriously: there is usually a pretty big gap between what "should" work and what actually works, as I am sure the authors are aware.

The paper presents a method for joint motion prediction and activity classification from sequences with two different applications: motion of fruit flies and online handwriting recognition.	O	O	Review	335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The method uses a classical encoder-decoder pipeline, with skip connections allowing direct communication between the encoder and the decoder on respective levels of abstraction.	O	O	Review	335
[line_break_token]Motion is discretized and predicted using classification.	O	O	Review	335
The model is trained on classification loss combined with a loss on motion prediction.	O	O	Review	335

However, the paper presents a couple of interesting ideas, partially inspired from other work in other areas.	O	O	Review	335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My biggest concern is with the experimental evaluation.	B-Review	B-1	Review	335
The experimental section contains a large amount of figures, which visualize what the model has learned in a qualitative way.	I-Review	I-1	Review	335
However, quantitative evaluation is rarer.	I-Review	I-1	Review	335
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- On the fly application, the authors compare the classification performance with another method previously published by the first author.	B-Review	B-2	Review	335
[line_break_token]- Again on the fly application, the performance gain on motion prediction in figure 5c looks small compared to the baseline.	B-Review	B-3	Review	335

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weaknesses:[line_break_token]- a critical discussion on the interplay between motion an behaviour that is needed to experience the benefits of their proposed model is missing from the paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	335
[line_break_token]- moreover, a discussion on how this approach could scale to more challenging scenarios "involving animals" and visual input for instance and more general "behaviours" is also missing;[line_break_token]The criticism here is pointed at the fact that the title/abstract claim general behaviour modelling, whilst the experiments are focused on two very specific and relatively simple scenarios,[line_break_token]making the original claim a little bit far fetched unless its backed up by additional evidence.

MAML (Finn+ 2017) is recast as a hierarchical Bayesian learning procedure.	O	O	Review	335

In addition, the point made by the TCML authors is fair ("nothing prevented you from...") and I would also recommend mentioning the reviewed paper's authors' decision (not to test deeper architectures) in the footnote.	I-Review	I-2	Review	335

Summary[line_break_token]The paper presents an interesting view on the recently proposed MAML formulation of meta-learning (Finn et al).	O	O	Review	335
The main contribution is a) insight into the connection between the MAML procedure and MAP estimation in an equivalent linear hierarchical Bayes model with explicit priors, b) insight into the connection between MAML and MAP estimation in non-linear HB models with implicit priors, c) based on these insights, the paper proposes a variant of MALM using a Laplace approximation (with additional approximations for the covariance matrix.

The paper proposes a novel data augmentations approach that improves the robustness of a model on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet Common Corruptions benchmarks while maintaining training accuracy on clean data.	O	O	Review	335
To achieve this, the paper proposes a rather simple augmentation mechanism that is inspired by CutOut (DeVries &amp; Taylor 2017) and Gaussian (Grandvalet &amp; Kanu, 1997): adding Gaussian noise to random patches in the image.	O	O	Review	335
This simple approach is shown to work surprisingly well on the corruption benchmarks.	O	O	Review	335
It seems reasonable that while adding Gaussian noise makes the model robust to high frequency noise, since Gaussian noise is not added everywhere, the model is able to exploit high frequency signal when available in the input.	B-Review	B-1	Review	335
The paper is reasonably well written and the experimental validation is convincing.	O	O	Review	335

*Summary*[line_break_token]This paper leverages the piecewise linearity of predictions in ReLU neural networks to encode and learn piecewise constant predictors akin to oblique decision trees (trees with splits made on linear combinations of features instead of axis-aligned splits).	O	O	Review	10028
The core observation is that the Jacobian of a ReLU network is piecewise constant w.r.t to the input.	O	O	Review	10028
This Jacobian is chosen to encode the hard splits of a decision tree.	O	O	Review	10028
The paper establishes an exact equivalence between decision trees and a slightly modified form of the locally constant networks (LCN).	O	O	Review	10028
The LCN used for experiments is slightly relaxed to allow for training, including "annealing" from a the softplus nonlinearity to ReLU during training, adding one or more output layers to perform the final prediction, and training with connection dropout.	O	O	Review	10028
Experiments show LCN models outperform existing methods for oblique decision trees, but ensembles are often matched or outperformed by random forests.	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]*Rating*[line_break_token]Perhaps the greatest attribute of decision trees is utter simplicity. (	O	O	Review	10028
The second best attribute the out-of-the-box competitive accuracy of tree ensembles on a wide variety of problems.)	O	O	Review	10028
An argument to be made for this paper is that it leverages the machinery of learning DNNs to learn more powerful, oblique tree-like models.	O	O	Review	10028
The counterpoint is that despite the added complication, it's still often beaten by ensembles of CART trees.	O	O	Review	10028
Overall, the idea is clever, the presentation could be improved slightly, and the experiments raise existential questions for this kind of work.	O	O	Review	10028
My current rating is weak reject.	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token](1) It's difficult to know how LCNs should be compared to traditional decision trees, with accuracy, number of parameters, prediction speed, and training time/parallelism as viable components.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10028
The paper focuses almost exclusively on accuracy, while cross-validating over model sizes and other hyperparameters.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10028
This is a reasonable choice, though a discussion of model size and prediction speed would be welcome.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10028
I do have two significant questions about the experiments:[line_break_token][line_break_token](2) It seems unfair that LCN has access to one or more hidden layers between the splits and the final output, denoted g_\phi.	B-Review	B-2	Review	10028
Would competing decision tree models improve with such a layer learned and appended to the final tree?	I-Review	I-2	Review	10028
Would LCN suffer from using a tabular representation like the others?	I-Review	I-2	Review	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token](3) Despite the assertion that these are datasets that necessitate tree-like predictors, the LLN method outperforms LCN and the trees on 4/5 datasets and is competitive with ensemble methods.	B-Review	B-3	Review	10028
While not explicitly stated, am I correct that LLN is essentially a traditional ReLU-network?	I-Review	I-3	Review	10028
If high accuracy is the goal, then why should I go to the trouble of training LCN when a traditional DNN is better.	I-Review	I-3	Review	10028
And if a tree is needed, then LCNs should be evaluated on more than just accuracy.	I-Review	I-3	Review	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token](4) LCNs seem to present a less bulky alternative to e.g. Deep Neural Decision Trees (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06988)," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06988),</a> but that work should be cited and discussed[line_break_token][line_break_token](5) The proof sketch in Section 3.6 of the equivalence between the "standard architecture" and decision trees is difficult to understand and not convincing. (	B-Review	B-5	Review	10028
On second reading I noticed the subtle vector "\mathbf 0" indicating that all entries of "\grad_x a^i_1" are zero.	I-Review	I-5	Review	10028
Some further exposition and enumeration of steps would clear up confusion.)	I-Review	I-5	Review	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token](6) Overall the presentation is reasonable, other than the notes below.	B-Review	B-6	Review	10028

2) In short, we have the following ordering of expressiveness *given a fixed depth*: oblique decision trees &gt; canonical (tabular) LCNs &gt;= standard LCNs.	O	O	Reply	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Note that each activation pattern of f yield a *constant* Jacobian, so we can write the Jacobian as Jacobian(o(x)), where o is the activation pattern of x. [line_break_token][line_break_token]Then, standard LCNs can be written as the mapping: [line_break_token]        g_\phi(Jacobian(o(x))).	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	10028
[line_break_token]In contrast, canonical (tabular) LCNs yield the mapping:[line_break_token][tab_token]g(o(x)).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10028
[line_break_token]Hence, the tabular case cannot be less powerful than using embeddings (Jacobians), since we can always set the table as g(  ) = g_\phi(Jacobian(  )).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]By the proof of Theorem 3, we can again transform such tabular LCN to a decision tree with the same depth, so the canonical LCNs are not more powerful than oblique decision trees.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10028
Furthermore, due to how the locally linear regions of f can be partitioned, canonical LCNs are strictly less powerful than oblique decision trees given a fixed depth M as proved in Sec.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10028

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Hence, we obtain the claimed ordering.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10028
In fact, by Theorem 8 (updated, originally given as a sketch of proof), we can even prove standard LCNs = canonical LCNs.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token](3) Yes, LLNs are ReLU networks.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	10028
The point of including LLN is to compare it with ALCN, since both are continuous functions and thus much more powerful than tree methods.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10028
We show that ALCN often outperforms LLN.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]If high accuracy is the only goal, currently random forests work well for these chemical/tabular data, outperforming neural networks with ReLU activations by a large margin.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10028
However, please see our general response above for why LCN still provides new insights in this setting.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]If a tree model is needed, clearly LCNs are much better than traditional oblique decision trees: we can often get 10% absolute improvements in testing AUC.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10028
Since LCN can always be explicitly converted to an oblique decision tree, the only difference *in testing time* between oblique decision trees and LCNs is the accuracy.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10028

Adding any number of layers mapping from the Jacobian to the prediction does not affect the piece-wise constant nature.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	10028

This paper proposes locally constant network (LCN), which is implemented via the gradient of piece-wise linear networks such as ReLU networks.	O	O	Review	10028
The authors built the equivalence between LCN and decision trees, and also demonstrated that LCN with M neurons has the same representation capability as decision trees with 2^M leaf nodes.	O	O	Review	10028
The experiments conducted in the paper disclose that training LCN outperforms other methods using decision trees.	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The detailed comments are as follows:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1) The idea of LCN is very interesting, and the equivalence to decision trees is also very valuable, as it provides interpretability and shines light on new training algorithms.	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) The derivation of LCN and the equivalence is clear.	O	O	Review	10028
The analysis based on the shared parameterization in Section 3.5 is helpful to understand why LCN with M neurons could be of equal capability to decision trees with 2^M leaf nodes.	O	O	Review	10028

In this paper, the authors proposed an approach to fit locally constant functions using deep neural networks (DNNs).	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token]The idea is based on the fact that DNN consisting of only linear transformations and ReLU activations is piecewise linear.	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token]Thus, the derivative of such a network with respect to the input is locally constant.	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the paper, the authors focused on connecting the locally constant network with oblique decision trees.	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token]Specifically, they proved that these two models are in some sense equivalent, and one can transform one model to another.	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token]This connection enables us to train the oblique decision trees by training the locally constant network instead.	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token]Because the locally constant network can be trained using the gradient-based methods, it would be much easier to train than the oblique decision trees.	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I think the paper is well-written and the idea is clear.	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token]Connecting the locally constant network with oblique decision trees looks interesting.	O	O	Review	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I have one concern, however.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10028
[line_break_token]The authors mention that the training of oblique decision trees is difficult, and the use of the locally constant network is helpful.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10028
[line_break_token]If I understand correctly, oblique decision tree is one specific instance of the hierarchical mixtures of experts.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10028
[line_break_token]And, [Ref1] pointed out that the hierarchical mixtures of experts can be trained using EM algorithm, which is another type of the gradient-based training.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10028
[line_break_token]The current paper misses such a prior study.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10028
[line_break_token]I am interested in to see if the use of locally constant network is truly effective for training oblique decision trees over the algorithms considered in the literatures of hierarchical mixtures of experts.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Ref1] Hierarchical mixtures of experts and the EM algorithm[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]### Updated after author response ###[line_break_token]The authors have successfully demonstrated that the proposed approach is better than the EM-like classical approaches.	B-Review	B-2	Review	10028
I therefore keep my score.	O	O	Review	10028
e thank the reviewer for the insightful comments and suggestions.	O	O	Reply	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To clarify the concern, there is a fundamental difference between hierarchical mixtures of experts (HMEs) and oblique decision trees.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	10028
HMEs use softmax units instead of decision units in non-terminal nodes, so HMEs only approach oblique decision trees in the theoretical limit.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10028
Hence, HMEs realize continuous functions instead of piece-wise constant functions as oblique decision trees.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]There are some practical advantages of using oblique decision trees over HMEs-style (soft) decision trees.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10028
For example, it requires a full tree traversal for HMEs to make a prediction in O(2^M) where M denotes the tree depth, while it only takes O(M) for oblique decision trees to make a prediction.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10028
Moreover, being piece-wise constant allows us to tractably compute some useful inference problems like ‚Äúwhat is the feasible region of input space that leads to a specific prediction value / diagnosis‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10028
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Nevertheless, we can still do an empirical comparison with HMEs.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10028
We use the HME implementation with the most stars on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/AmazaspShumik/Mixture-Models" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/AmazaspShumik/Mixture-Models</a>[line_break_token][line_break_token]Even with parallel computing on 16 CPUs, the implementation is still prohibitively slow due to the inherent complexity of the HME learning algorithm (exponential to tree depth), and we can only obtain some early results on small datasets.

Overview: [line_break_token]The authors proposed a weakly-supervised method to localize video moments given text queries.	O	O	Review	10041
 The model builds multi-level relational graphs among pairs of word and video frame, and the graph is used to aggregate visual-semantic feature for each word and each frame.	O	O	Review	10041
Then the attentive features are used to localize the sentence query in videos by calculating the similarity of words and frames.	O	O	Review	10041
In summary, the proposed weakly-supervised Moment Alignment Network (wMAN) utilizes a multi-level co-attention mechanism to learn richer multimodal representations for language based video retrieval..[line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros:[line_break_token]1.	B-Review	B-4	Review	10041
Significant performance improvement on Didemo and Charades-STA datasets.	O	O	Review	10041

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons:[line_break_token]1.	B-Review	B-4	Review	10041
The overall novelty of the proposed methods is limited.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10041
Essentially, the key points of the model is hierarchical visual semantic co-attention.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10041
,which is proposed originally in [Hierarchical Question-Image Co-Attention[line_break_token]for Visual Question Answering], although the original application is VQA in image domain.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10041

This work presents a model for text based video clip (video moments or text-to-clip) retrieval.	O	O	Review	10041
The goal is to identify a video segment within a longer video that is most relevant to an input sentence.	O	O	Review	10041
Authors propose a new model based on a weakly-supervised training approach.	O	O	Review	10041
This model does not require explicit temporal annotations to align text and video, but it only needs as an input the full video and sentence pairs.	O	O	Review	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Key aspects of the model are: i) A coattention step frame-by-word and word-by-frame that produces the basic embeddings of the model, which is enriched with positional information, and ii) A contextual step that aggregates contextual information from all the frames using graph propagation.	O	O	Review	10041
Afterwards, they use a  LogSumExp pooling strategy to score similarity among the input sentence and video frame.	O	O	Review	10041
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]The main contribution of the paper is incremental (specially respect to Mithun et al 2019), I do not see a ground-breaking contribution.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10041
One of the main novelties with respect to previous text-to-clip models is the use of co-attention schemes at the level of words and frames.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10041
However, the idea of co-attention at different grain-levels have been proposed before.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10041
Actually, while the model makes an extensive use of frame-to-word encoding, it is not clear to me what is the role of the word-to-video representation in Eqs.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10041
5 and 6.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In general, the paper is well written.	B-Review	B-2	Review	10041
The experimental evaluation is convincing.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10041
However, it is not clear why authors change the structure of the evaluation among the experiments.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10041
As an example, for the experiments in Charades-STA dataset, they include scores for different IOUs levels, but they do not repeat this for DiDeMo dataset.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10041
Similarly, for DiDeMo dataset, results in Table 3 are for the test set, while the ablation study in Table 4 is for the validation set.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10041
I will recommend to standardize the evaluations.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Another comment is that in several experiment best performance is obtained using just the FBW module, it will be interesting to further analyze why the contextual cues hurt performance in some cases, maybe at least a qualitative analysis.	B-Review	B-3	Review	10041
Also, in some part of the papers, authors state that the proposed model does better than strongly-supervised state-of-the-art methods on some metrics, looking all the reported tables, I do not think that this is the case.	I-Review	I-3	Review	10041
Authors show qualitative results about cases where the model perform well, it will be good to also analyze failure cases, actually, according to the final scores, there is still lot of cases that the model can't handle properly.	I-Review	I-3	Review	10041

The paper proposed a weakly-supervised wMAN model for moment localization in untrimmed videos.	O	O	Review	10041
Only the video-level annotation is available for training, and the goal is retrieving the video segment described by the sentence.	O	O	Review	10041
The proposed model explored to utilize better context information and captured the relation between video and sentence/word via graph neural networks.	O	O	Review	10041
In particular, instead of modeling the context information between the sentence and each video frame, wMAN tried to learn the representation with multi-level and co-attention, which considers all possible pairs between the word and the frame.	O	O	Review	10041

PE seems to be important for wMAN, and the authors provides few sentences analysis about this, but I don't think I fully understand this part.	I-Review	I-4	Review	10041
Another problem is that there is only few qualitative results, and in both these two examples, predicted results cover the GT segments.	I-Review	I-4	Review	10041

[line_break_token]Summary:[line_break_token]This paper proposes a method for aligning an input text with the frames in a video that correspond to what the text describes in a weakly supervised way.	O	O	Review	10041
The authors propose a combination of a ‚ÄúFrame-By-Word‚Äù (FBW) representation and a Word-Conditioned Visual Graph (WCVG).	O	O	Review	10041
The proposed method outperforms the weakly supervised baseline presented in the paper in experiments by a large margin.	O	O	Review	10041
In addition, it quantitatively performs close to previous strongly supervised methods.	O	O	Review	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros:[line_break_token]+ New Word-Conditioned Visual Graph representation[line_break_token]+ Outperforms weakly supervised baseline[line_break_token]+ Ablation study of the moving parts[line_break_token]+ Interesting use of positional embeddings for multi-modal learning[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weaknesses / comments:[line_break_token]- What is the processing speed of the method compared to the baseline?	O	O	Review	10041
[line_break_token]The proposed method makes multiple comparisons while computing the attention weights over all words and frames.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10041
Does this cause the method to be slower than the baseline?	I-Review	I-1	Review	10041
If so, how much slower is it?	I-Review	I-1	Review	10041
[line_break_token]Answers to these questions can help readers to keep in mind the trade-off of the proposed method for achieving the accuracy presented in the paper.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]- Number of parameters comparison with baseline:[line_break_token]Did the authors make sure to have similar number of model parameters for the baselines and the proposed method?	B-Review	B-2	Review	10041
Maybe I missed it, but I couldn‚Äôt see a mention of this anywhere.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10041
It would be useful to state this so that readers are sure that it‚Äôs not the number of parameters that is helping the method.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]- Assumption that sentences are only associated with its ground truth video:[line_break_token]The authors mention that they have the same assumption as Mithun et al 2019.	B-Review	B-3	Review	10041
Can this assumption be detrimental if the dataset does not follow it?	I-Review	I-3	Review	10041
Say there are sentences in the dataset that could describe segments in multiple videos.	I-Review	I-3	Review	10041
Could this assumption lead to suboptimal representation learning / relationship learning for words / video frames?	I-Review	I-3	Review	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Determining the size of the sliding window:[line_break_token]From reading the paper, it looks like the sliding window used for computing the word / frame relationships has to be manually defined.	B-Review	B-4	Review	10041
This seems a bit suboptimal for the generalizability of this method.	I-Review	I-4	Review	10041
Do the authors have any comments on this?	I-Review	I-4	Review	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Can this model be supervised?	B-Review	B-5	Review	10041
If so, how does it compare to the supervised baselines?	I-Review	I-5	Review	10041
[line_break_token]The authors point out that their weakly supervised method performs close to the strongly supervised previously proposed.	I-Review	I-5	Review	10041
This is a nice finding, however, have the authors try to answer the question of what would happen if the proposed model is supervised?	I-Review	I-5	Review	10041
Will the proposed model outperform the strongly supervised baselines?	I-Review	I-5	Review	10041
Or at least perform the same?	I-Review	I-5	Review	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Conclusion:[line_break_token]In conclusion, the proposed method makes sense and it has been shown to empirically outperforms a previous weakly supervised baseline.	O	O	Review	10041
The authors also provide an ablation study of the moving parts to show that the entire pipeline is important to achieve the highest performance in the hardest setting.	O	O	Review	10041
It would be nice if the authors successfully answer / address the questions / concerns mentioned above in the rebuttal.	O	O	Review	10041

We address your concerns below.	O	O	Reply	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- What is the processing speed of the method compared to the baseline?	O	O	Reply	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In our measurements, the TGA method takes approximately 4.725s to process a single query.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	10041
In contrast, the FBW module and our combined model (wMAN) take 4.329s and 8.102s respectively.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10041
As evident, the difference in processing time is not significant.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10041
However, if speed were really a huge concern, using the FBW module alone would provide a much faster processing time as well as improved results over the TGA method.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10041
For reference, the TGA model obtains an average recall accuracy of 49.8% while the FBW module achieves 57.0%.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Number of parameters comparison with baseline[line_break_token][line_break_token]The TGA model contains about 3M parameters while wMAN contains 18M parameters.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	10041
However, the large performance gains are not directly attributed to the increase in parameters.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10041
To prove this, we increase the dimensions of feature representations as well as relevant fully-connected layers in TGA such that the total number of parameters becomes 19M. We evaluate this model on Charades-Sta and the results are provided in Table 5 in the appendix.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10041
As evident, even with more parameters than our model, it still does substantially worse than ours.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10041
To add on to this, our direct adaptation of the Language-Conditioned Graph Network (also provided in Table 5), which has 152M parameters, also yields results inferior to ours.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10041
Finally, we also decrease the number of parameters in the FBW module alone to 3M and its performance gain over the TGA model is still significant.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Assumption that sentences are only associated with its ground truth video[line_break_token][line_break_token]This assumption does add random noise to the training process.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	10041
However, there is a higher probability of assigning a non-relevant sentence that does not correspond to its ground truth video than to the contrary.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10041
With that said, this assumption is also often used in tasks such as image-sentence retrieval or phrase grounding.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Determining the size of the sliding window[line_break_token][line_break_token]We definitely agree with this.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	10041
In response to this, we simply adopted the same candidate proposals adopted by the baseline and prior work for fair comparisons.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	10041
However, this is an interesting avenue for future work and we are actually exploring possible ways of replacing these manually-defined sliding window mechanism with an efficient subwindow search algorithm.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Can this model be supervised?	O	O	Reply	10041
If so, how does it compare to the supervised baselines?	O	O	Reply	10041
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Our model should be easily generalizable to the strongly-supervised setting.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	10041
Due to time constraints and other commitments, we do not have the time to adapt it to the strongly-supervised setting for this rebuttal, but this is an interesting future work direction.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	10041

This paper considers the problem of few-shot learning and proposes a new embedding-based approach.	O	O	Review	1616
In contrast to previous work (such as Matching Networks and Prototypical Networks) where distance is computed in pure embedding space, this work proposes computing a low-dimensional subspace to represent a class and using the distance from an embedded query point to this subspace.	O	O	Review	1616
The low-dimensional subspace for a class is computed by running truncated Singular Value Decomposition on the normalized embeddings of all points in the support set for that class and using the top n left singular vectors as the basis for the class's subspace.	O	O	Review	1616
The authors also propose an extension to their model to the semi-supervised few-shot learning setting by incorporating masked-mean computation and zero-mean cluster for distractor items (both ideas borrowed from Renn 2017 for prototypical networks).	O	O	Review	1616
Experiments are conducted on Mini-Imagenet in the few-shot learning setting and on Mini-Imagenet and Tiered-ImageNet in the semi-supervised few-shot learning setting.	O	O	Review	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros:[line_break_token]- Proposed idea is novel and proposes an interesting change to existing embedding-based few-shot learning techniques.	O	O	Review	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons:[line_break_token]- Performance benefit is a bit disappointing; Mini-Imagenet few-shot performance improvement relative to Prototypical-Nets is minimal (barely 1% for 5way-5shot and 20way-5shot case).	B-Review	B-1	Review	1616
For semi-supervised experiments, there is bigger improvement for Mini-Imagenet (4% for both without distractors and with distractors) but less so for Tiered-ImageNet (close to 0% for without distractors and with distractors).	I-Review	I-1	Review	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Remarks:[line_break_token]- The paper seems to be missing what the dimensionality of the subspace is for the experiments?	B-Review	B-2	Review	1616
Was this picked using validation set performance?	I-Review	I-2	Review	1616
[line_break_token]- In first paragraph of page 2, it seems too strong to say "...this makes our paper unparalleled to previous studies"; maybe change to "...this make our proposed model novel relative to previous work"[line_break_token]- Is there previous work that has involved back-propagating through SVD?	B-Review	B-3	Review	1616
It would be useful to mention these as references.	B-Review	B-4	Review	1616
[line_break_token]- In Figure 1, it is visually shown how outliers can negatively impact Matching-Networks and Prototypical-Networks but not visually shown how PSN is resistant to them?	B-Review	B-5	Review	1616
[line_break_token]- The claim is made that the proposed method is more robust to outliers.	B-Review	B-6	Review	1616
Is there more of a justification that can be given for this?	I-Review	I-6	Review	1616
Either in terms of some intuition or an experiment that can be run?	I-Review	I-6	Review	1616
For example, can it be shown that outliers cause the prototype of a class to move a lot (in terms of distance from original prototype without outliers) whereas the original subspace compared to subspace with outliers is less different by measuring this on Mini-Imagenet?	I-Review	I-6	Review	1616
[line_break_token]- Typo on page 5: "in what follwos" => "in what follows"[line_break_token]- In Discussion, paper states, "Moreover, the Prototypical Network makes use of the class mean and can be easily incorporated in our testbed": what does this mean exactly?	B-Review	B-8	Review	1616

[line_break_token]To address the reviewer's comment, we studied the effect of subspace dimension in Section 6 and Appendix B. We examined on four different subspace dimensions on 5-way 5-shot and 5-way 20-shot for training and testing stage and found that the performance is not affected badly.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616

This paper proposes a Projective Subspace Network (PSN) for few-shot learning.	O	O	Review	1616
The PSN represents each support set of classes as a subspace obtained by SVD.	O	O	Review	1616

Instead of using the prototype of the class center, the subspace representation is more robust to outliers.	O	O	Review	1616

This paper presents a new method for fully- and semi-supervised few-shot classification that is based on learning a general embedding as usual, and then learning a sub-space of it for each class.	O	O	Review	1616
A query point is then classified as the class whose sub-space is closest to it.	O	O	Review	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Pros: This is a neat idea and achieves competitive results.	O	O	Review	1616
Learning a sub-space per class makes intuitive sense to me since it‚Äôs plausible that there is a lower-dimensional subspace of the overall embedding space that captures the properties that are common to only examples of a certain class.	O	O	Review	1616
If this is indeed the case, it seems that indeed classifying query examples into classes based on their distances from the corresponding sub-spaces would lead to good discrimination.	O	O	Review	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Cons: First, an inherent limitation is that this approach is not applicable to one-shot learning, and I have doubts in its merit for very low shot learning (explained below).	B-Review	B-1	Review	1616
Second, I‚Äôm missing the justification behind a key point used to motivate the approach, which requires clarification (explained below).	B-Review	B-2	Review	1616
Third, I feel that certain aspects of the approach were unclear (details to follow).	B-Review	B-3	Review	1616
Finally, I feel more analysis is needed to better understand the differences of this method from previous work (concrete suggestions follow).	B-Review	B-4	Review	1616
For semi-supervised learning, the novelty regarding how the unlabeled examples are incorporated is limited, as the approach used is previously-introduced in Ren et al, 2018.	B-Review	B-5	Review	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, even though I like the idea and the results are good, there are a few points, mentioned in the above section that I feel require additional work before I can strongly recommend acceptance.	O	O	Review	1616
Most importantly, relating to getting more intuition about why and when this works best, and tying it in better with previous approaches.	O	O	Review	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A key point requiring clarification.	O	O	Review	1616
[line_break_token]There is a key fact that the authors used to motivate this approach which remains unclear to me: why is it the case that this approach is less sensitive to outliers than previous approaches?	B-Review	B-2	Review	1616
In Figure 1, an outlier is pictured in each of subfigures (a) and (b) corresponding to Matching and Prototypical Networks, but not in subfigure (c) which corresponds to PSN.	I-Review	I-2	Review	1616
No explanation is provided to justify this conjecture, other than empirical evaluation that is based on the overall accuracy only.	I-Review	I-2	Review	1616
In particular, since SVD is used to obtain the sub-spaces, instead of an end-to-end learned projector that directly optimizes the query set accuracy, it‚Äôs not clear why if a support point is an outlier it would not affect the sub-space creation.	I-Review	I-2	Review	1616
If I‚Äôm missing something, please clarify!	I-Review	I-2	Review	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token](A) Comments on the approach.	O	O	Review	1616
[line_break_token](1) Why define X_k as the support set examples minus the class prototype instead of just the support examples themselves?	B-Review	B-6	Review	1616
The latter seems simpler, and should have all the required information for shaping the class‚Äô subspace.	I-Review	I-6	Review	1616
[line_break_token](2) Note that if X_k is defined as [x_{k,1}, \dots, x_{k,K}] as proposed in the above point (ie.	B-Review	B-7	Review	1616
without subtracting the class mean from each support point) then this method would have been applicable to 1-shot too.	I-Review	I-7	Review	1616
How would it then compare to a 1-shot Prototypical Network?	I-Review	I-7	Review	1616
Notice that in this case the mean of the class is equal to this one example.	I-Review	I-7	Review	1616
[line_break_token](3) In general, the truncated SVD decomposition for a class can be written using the matrices U, \Sigma and V^T with dimensions [D, n], [n, n] and [n, K] respectively, where D is the embedding dimensionality and K is the number of support points belonging to the given class.	B-Review	B-8	Review	1616
The middle matrix \Sigma in the non-truncated version would have dimensions [D, K]. Does this mean that when truncating, n is enforced to be smaller than each of D and K?	I-Review	I-8	Review	1616
This would mean that the dimensionality n of the sub-space is limited by the number of the support examples, which in some cases may be very small in few-shot learning.	I-Review	I-8	Review	1616
Can you comment on this?	I-Review	I-8	Review	1616
[line_break_token](4) How to set n (the dimensionality of each subspace) is not obvious.	B-Review	B-9	Review	1616
What values were explored?	I-Review	I-9	Review	1616
Is there a sweet spot in the trade-off between the observed complexity and the final accuracy?	I-Review	I-9	Review	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token](B) Comparison with Prototypical Networks.	B-Review	B-4	Review	1616
[line_break_token](1) In what situations do we expect learning a sub-space per class to do better than learning a  prototype per class?	I-Review	I-4	Review	1616
For example, Figure 4 shows the test-time performance as a function of the test ‚Äòway‚Äô.	I-Review	I-4	Review	1616
A perhaps more interesting analysis would be to compare the models‚Äô performance as a function of the test *shot*: if more examples are available it may be less appropriate to create a prototype and more beneficial to create a sub-space?	I-Review	I-4	Review	1616
[line_break_token](2) Can we recover Prototypical Networks as a special case of PSN?	I-Review	I-4	Review	1616
If so, how?	I-Review	I-4	Review	1616
It would be neat to show under which conditions these are equivalent.	I-Review	I-4	Review	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token](C) Clarifications regarding the semi-supervised setup.	B-Review	B-5	Review	1616
[line_break_token](1) Are distractor classes sampled from a disjoint pool of classes, or is it that, for example, a class which is a distractor in an episode is a non-distractor in another episode.	I-Review	I-5	Review	1616
[line_break_token](2) Similarly for labeled / unlabaled at training time.	I-Review	I-5	Review	1616
Can the same example appear as labeled in one episode but unlabaled in another?	I-Review	I-5	Review	1616
In Ren et al, 2018, this was prevented by creating an additional labeled/unlabeled split even for the training examples.	I-Review	I-5	Review	1616
Therefore they use strictly less overall information at meta-training time than if that split weren‚Äôt used.	I-Review	I-5	Review	1616
To be comparable with them, it‚Äôs important to apply this same setup.	I-Review	I-5	Review	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token](D) Additional minor comments.	B-Review	B-10	Review	1616
[line_break_token](1) ‚ÄúTo work at the presence of distractors, we propose to use a fake class with zero mean‚Äù.	I-Review	I-10	Review	1616
Note that this was already proposed in Ren et al, 2018.	I-Review	I-10	Review	1616
They used a zero-mean, high-variance additional cluster whose aim was to ‚Äòsoak up‚Äô the distractor examples to prevent them for polluting legitimate clusters (this was the second model they proposed).	I-Review	I-10	Review	1616
[line_break_token](2) In the introduction, regarding contribution iii.	I-Review	I-10	Review	1616
A more appropriate way to describe this is as exploring generalization to different numbers of classes, or ‚Äòways‚Äô at test time than what was used at training time.	I-Review	I-10	Review	1616
[line_break_token](3) Gidaris and Komodakis (2018) is described in the related work as using a more complicated pipeline.	I-Review	I-10	Review	1616
Note however that their pipeline is in place for solving a more challenging problem than standard few-shot classification: they study how a model can maintain the ability to remember training classes while rapidly learning about new ‚Äòtest‚Äô classes.	I-Review	I-10	Review	1616
[line_break_token](4) In the last line of section 5.3, use N-way instead of K-way since in the rest of the paper K was used to refer to the shot, not the way.	I-Review	I-10	Review	1616
[line_break_token]	O	O	Review	1616
[line_break_token]Q: ``Why is it the case that ... less sensitive to outliers ...''[line_break_token][line_break_token]A: A prototype in the Prototypical Networks (PN) is the average of a set and as such is sensitive to any perturbation of the set, outliers being one.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	1616
On the other hand, in PSN, a set is represented by a subspace.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
To have a noticeable change in the orientation of the subspace, one needs to induce drastic changes to the set.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
Having said this, we performed two extra-experiments to reinforce our conjecture here.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In the first one, depicted in Fig.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
2, we empirically studied the decision boundaries of PSN and PN.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
The samples (triangle symbol) are drawn from the normal distribution for a two-class problem (column 1 and 2) and a problem with three classes (column 3 and 4).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
The outliers (square symbol) are spread around initial samples.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
The facecolors for outliers indicate to which class they have been assigned.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
In the odd columns, we can see that the prototypes and subspaces discriminate the classes equally well.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
[line_break_token]However, in the even columns, it is clearly shown that the outliers sway the prototypes and their decision boundaries while the subspace approach handles them more robustly.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
  [line_break_token][line_break_token]In the second experiment, placed in appendix A, we provide the 5-way 5-shot and 5-way 10-shot results on the Mini-ImageNet by adding outliers and noise to support examples.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
There are two setups conducted to examine the robustness of PSN to outliers and additive noise.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
In the first experiment, the support set contains samples from classes absent in this set.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
We did not split the dataset into disjoint inlier/outlier sets though, as the outliers were only presented at the test time, leading to more realistic experiments.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
In the second experiment, perturbations were generated from a Gaussian distribution with random mean and predefined [line_break_token]variance.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
The results shown in Fig.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
4 demonstrate that on both tasks, PSN outperforms PN by a significant gap.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
Note that, we utilized the same CNN architecture (4-convolutional layers) for both PSN and PN.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q: ``Why define as the support set examples minus the class prototype instead of just the support examples themselves?''	O	O	Reply	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A: Our idea here is to represent a class by an affine subspace which is indeed a generalization of [line_break_token]the concept of linear subspace (where the origin is a common point).	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	1616
We indeed started by using linear-subspaces to model each class but empirically found that affine subspaces perform slightly better.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1616
To address this comment, we have added a remark to Section 6.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q: ``How would it then compare to a 1-shot Prototypical Network?''	O	O	Reply	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A: We cannot build an affine subspace with only one example per class, as such we cannot use PSN to address 1-shot learning problems per se.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	1616
However, simply augmenting support images to obtain two or more samples per class alleviates such an issue straight away.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	1616
However, this simple issue is beyond the points we make in our paper (it is an orthogonal research direction in one- and few-shot learning).	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	1616
We have reflected this in Section 6 of the revised draft to address the reviewer's comment.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	1616
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q: ``Does this mean the dimensionality n of the sub-space is limited by the number of the support examples''[line_break_token][line_break_token]A: Affirmative.	B-Reply	B-8	Reply	1616
Our idea is to construct a subspace representing the set.	I-Reply	I-8	Reply	1616
The reviewer's comment raises an interesting point, whether parts of the orthogonal complement of each subspace can be used to make better decisions.	I-Reply	I-8	Reply	1616
We believe that investigating the effect of orthogonal complements demands a dedicated study and goes beyond our work.	I-Reply	I-8	Reply	1616
Having said this, we reflect this comment in Section 7.	I-Reply	I-8	Reply	1616

We completely agree that Xu et al 2019 did fundamental work in this area, and Theorem 3 is a natural extension of the work they did.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	10120
Xu's original theorem seemed to implicate that GNNs aggregating over the immediate neighborhood are naturally constrained to 1-WL, and we show that by very so slightly changing the definition of the immediate neighborhood (L_1 arguably is still the immediate neighborhood) gives theoretically greater power.

Moreover, the fact that it captures triangles leads to favorable performance in many areas.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10120
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Furthermore, we believe Theorem 1 and Theorem 4 bring new contributions: specifically Theorem 1 formalizes what the N-GCN paper was proposing (look at larger aggregation regions) and shows that our hierarchy is complete under any aggregating regions that can be defined under the distance metric.

Here is an initial response:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Reply	10120
We completely agree that Xu et al 2019 did fundamental work in this area, and Theorem 3 is a natural extension of the work they did.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	10120
Xu's original theorem seemed to implicate that GNNs aggregating over the immediate neighborhood are naturally constrained to 1-WL, and we show that by very so slightly changing the definition of the immediate neighborhood (L_1 arguably is still the immediate neighborhood) gives theoretically greater power.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10120
Moreover, the fact that it captures triangles leads to favorable performance in many areas.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10120
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Furthermore, we believe Theorem 1 and Theorem 4 bring new contributions: specifically Theorem 1 formalizes what the N-GCN paper was proposing (look at larger aggregation regions) and shows that our hierarchy is complete under any aggregating regions that can be defined under the distance metric.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10120
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Theorem 4 shows that our framework can, in the limit, discriminate between all graphs.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10120
Graph discrimination from a local point of view is hard (as from a local point one does not know if there are other disconnected segments), and the proof required the use of a special case of the Graph Reconstruction Conjecture.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	10120
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	O	O	Reply	10120
We believe this would lead to the ability to better utilize node features in a more nontrivial/nonlinear way (as we can combine node features across greater regions) and should improve results for harder node classification tasks.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	10120
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3.	O	O	Reply	10120
We agree that the baselines are not absolute state-of-the-art in each of these tasks.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	10120
However, N-GCN and k-GNN represent the SOTA in moving away from immediate node aggregations, and their innovations are not orthogonal to other innovations (attention, residual, etc) in GNNs that would enable it to achieve better results.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10120
We chose not to include these to show clearly where the result improvement is coming from.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10120
Our results show that just by adding the L1 aggregation region, we are able to exceed results from N-GCN (which were missing the L-type aggregation regions, but theoretically looks at information up to 6 hops) and k-GNN (3 hops), demonstrating the importance of utilizing the hierarchy.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10120
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The QM7b and QM9 datasets are extremely large chemical/biological molecule datasets which are prized as large real-world databases.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10120
This datasets were not specifically targeted for our purpose and the molecule dynamics are affected by many highly nonlinear, nontrivial, and nonlocal interactions between the atoms.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10120
Therefore, the fact that our models outperforms others in this regime is significant and potentially important for biological applications	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	10120

The organization of the paper also needs to be improved a lot for publication.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For these reasons, I clearly reject this paper for publications.	O	O	Review	20634

[line_break_token][line_break_token]That is correct and the paper is completely open about that limitation; see footnote 2 in the paper.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20634
This allows us to leverage the gradient descent framework and also makes signGD converge with a constant step size to begin with.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
We are thus baffled by your claim that we ‚Äúchange the problem‚Äù as there's still a lot of insight to be gained from this analysis.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This rescaling of the update direction can be rolled into the step size.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634

This paper studies sign gradient descent in the framework of steepest descent with respect to a general norm.	O	O	Review	20634
The authors show the connection to a smoothness with respect to a general norm, which is further related to a bound on the Hessian.	O	O	Review	20634
Based on the interpretation of steepest descent, the authors compare the behavior of sign gradient descent with the gradient descent, and show that the relative behavior depends on both the percentage of diagonal ?	O	O	Review	20634
and the spread of eigenvalues.	O	O	Review	20634
Some experimental results are reported to verify the theory.	O	O	Review	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper is very well written and easy to follow.	O	O	Review	20634
The theoretical analysis is sound and intuitive.	O	O	Review	20634
However, the paper considers a variant of sign gradient descent where the l_1 norm of the gradients are introduced.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20634
The introduction of this l_1 norm is required for the interpretation of a steep descent but is not the one used often in practice.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Most analysis seem follows from standard arguments.	O	O	Review	20634
The extension from gradient descent to the steep descent with a general norm is a bit standard.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20634

The steepest descent framework is not the subject matter of the paper, it is merely a tool that we use to analyze sign gradient descent.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20634
The novelty lies in understanding the properties determining the performance of sign gradient descent, which we do by analyzing the non-Euclidean smoothness constant arising from the steepest descent framework	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20634

This paper analyzes the performance of sign gradient descent as a function of the ‚Äúgeometry‚Äù of the objective.	O	O	Review	20634
They contrast the performance of sign GD to gradient descent.	O	O	Review	20634
Both algorithms are steepest descent methods with respect to different norms.	O	O	Review	20634
Overall, I do not think the insights claimed in the paper are especially novel.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20634
It is already known that the choice of a norm can have a significant impact on the speed of steepest descent but practically, the performance depends on quantities that are unknown such as the norm of the gradient over the specific trajectory of the algorithm.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20634
I do not find the arguments in section 4 especially convincing as they seem rather high-level to me.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20634
Instead I would find it more valuable if one could make a statement about the performance of signGD as a function of known quantities.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20634
One could perhaps start by analyzing a specific class of functions (quadratics, Polyak-Lojasiewicz functions, ‚Ä¶).	I-Review	I-2	Review	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Prior work[line_break_token]It seems to me that most results discussed in the paper are already known in the optimization community.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20634
The book by Boyd &amp; Vandenberghe (cited by the authors) has an entire section on the ‚ÄúChoice of norm for steepest descent‚Äù where they indeed explain that the choice of the norm used for steepest descent can potentially have a dramatic effect on the convergence rate.	O	O	Review	20634
Can the authors explain how they see their contribution compared to prior work?	B-Review	B-3	Review	20634
I could concede that the result of Proposition 3 is somewhat novel, although I think the authors should discuss prior work on axis-alignment, which dates back to [line_break_token]Becker, Sue, and Yann Le Cun. "	I-Review	I-3	Review	20634

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Stochastic setting[line_break_token]Can the authors comment on generalizing their results to a stochastic setting?	B-Review	B-4	Review	20634
Since the gradients have a larger norm when using the infinity norm, I would expect that the variance is also larger.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experimental results[line_break_token]The empirical results on the neural networks do not seem especially convincing, and the authors do seem to acknowledge this.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20634

Have you considered optimizing smaller models first? (	I-Review	I-5	Review	20634

We address these two larger points first and then respond to specific questions/comments below.	O	O	Reply	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token](1) Novelty and discussion of prior work[line_break_token][line_break_token]After reading your review, we agree with you that we need to do a better job at contrasting with prior work to make our contributions stand out.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20634
We will update the paper shortly.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
We want to summarize for you what we see as the main contributions of our work.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
We believe that these are substantial and warrant publication.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
We hope that you will reconsider your judgement of their novelty in light of our response.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The main goal of the paper is to understand the properties of the objective function which determine the performance of sign gradient descent relative to gradient descent.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
We do not achieve a full characterization (which we acknowledge, see also next comment) but we make the following contributions towards this goal which can not be found in any prior work:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- We show that the smoothness constant for any norm arises as a bound on the Hessian in an induced matrix norm, relating it to properties of the Hessian.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
This is, of course, known for the Euclidean norm but we are not aware of any published works considering the general case.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- For the smoothness constant w.r.t.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
the maximum norm, which is pertinent to the performance of signGD, we show an upper bound based on axis alignment and the eigenvalues.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
This sensitivity of signGD to the axis alignment has never been discussed before.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Based on that, we compare of GD and signGD.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
This comparison is qualitative since, as you point out, it depends on the unknown gradient norms over the trajectory of the algorithms.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
We also verify it experimentally for quadratic functions.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- We explain how our insights relate to the "separable smoothness" assumption made in prior works on sign(S)GD.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
We clarify its meaning by showing that the sensitivity to axis alignment is hidden in the l_i values.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
We further show that this assumption can be replaced with the (weaker) assumption of max-norm smoothness in all existing results on sign(S)GD.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
I.e., we relax the assumptions of existing works while also clarifying the properties of the objective encoded in the assumption.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token]With regards to the specific works you mentioned in your review:[line_break_token]- Thanks for the pointer to Becker &amp; Le Cun (1988), which supports our point that axis-alignment is a feature of neural network training objectives.	O	O	Reply	20634
We will add a brief discussion to the paper.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20634
Their interest in axis alignment stems from diagonal approximations in second order methods, which is an orthogonal direction.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20634
[line_break_token]- Boyd &amp; Vanderberghe indeed discuss how the choice of norm affects the convergence of steepest descent methods.	O	O	Reply	20634
However, the chapter ‚Äúchoice of norm for steepest descent‚Äù exclusively discusses quadratic norms resulting in preconditioned gradient descent methods.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token](2) Inconclusiveness of the results.	O	O	Reply	20634
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We concede that the results in Section 4 are qualitative more than quantitative.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20634
As you rightly point out, this is because in addition to the smoothness constants, the performance depends on the gradient norms over the trajectory, which we can't get non-trivial lower bounds on.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20634
We nevertheless believe that understanding the smoothness constant gives important insights.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20634
We also verify this experimentally on quadratic functions	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20634

This paper introduces a new method to make ensembles of decision trees differentiable, and trainable with (stochastic) gradient descent.	O	O	Review	10099
The proposed technique relies on the concept of "oblivious decision trees", which are a kind of decision trees that use the same classifier (i.e. a feature and threshold) for all the nodes that have the same depth.	O	O	Review	10099
This means that for an oblivious decision tree of depth d, only d classifiers are learned.	O	O	Review	10099
Said otherwise, an oblivious decision tree is a classifier that split the data using d splitting features, giving a decision table of size 2^d.	O	O	Review	10099
To make oblivious decision trees differentiable, the authors propose to learn linear classifiers using all the features, but add a sparsity inducing operator on the weights of the classifiers (the entmax transformation).	O	O	Review	10099
Similarly, the step function used to split the data is replaced by a continuous version (here a binary entmax transformation).	O	O	Review	10099
Finally, the decision function is obtained by taking the outer product of all the scores of the classifiers: [c_1(x), 1-c_1(x)] o [c_2(x), 1-c_2(x)] ... This "choice" operator transforms the d dimensional vectors of the classifier scores to a 2^d dimensional vector.	O	O	Review	10099
Another interpretation of the proposed "differentiable oblivious decision trees" is a two layer neural network, with sparsity on the weights of the first layer,[line_break_token]and an activation function combining the entmax transformation and the outer product operator.	O	O	Review	10099
The authors then propose to combine multiple differentiable decision trees in one layer, giving the neural decision oblivious ensemble (NODE).	O	O	Review	10099
Finally, several NODE layers can be combined in a dense net fashion, to obtain a deep decision tree model.	O	O	Review	10099
The proposed method is evaluated on 6 datasets (half classification, half regression), and compared to existing decision tree methods such as XGBoost or CatBoost, as well as feed forward neural networks.	O	O	Review	10099
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper is clearly written, ideas are well presented, and it is easy to follow the derivation of the method.	O	O	Review	10099
As a minor comment, I would suggest to the authors to give more details on the EntMax method, as it is quite important for the method, but not really introduced in the paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	10099
The proposed algorithm is sound, and a nice way to make decision trees differentiable.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10099
One concern that I have though, is that it seems that NODE are close to fully connected neural networks, with sparsity on the weights.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10099
Indeed, I think that there are two ingredients in the paper to derive the method: adding sparsity to the weights and the outer product operator (as described in the previous paragraph).	I-Review	I-1	Review	10099
In particular, the improvement over vanilla feed forward neural networks seem small in the experimental section.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10099
I thus believe that it would be interesting to study if both two differences with feed forward networks are important, or if only is enough to get better results.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10099
[line_break_token][line_break_token]To conclude, I believe that this is a well written paper, proposing a differentiable version of decision trees which is interesting.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10099
However, the proposed method relies on existing techniques, such as EntMax, and I wonder if the (relatively small) improvement compared to feed forward network comes from these.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10099
I believe that it would thus be interesting to compare the method with feed forward network with sparsity on the weights.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10099
For now, I am putting a weak reject decision, but I am willing to reconsider my rating based on the author response.	O	O	Review	10099

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Detailed Review:[line_break_token][line_break_token]The introduction needs to define "tabular data".	B-Review	B-1	Review	10099
In your case, it seems that you mean mostly numerical heterogeneous features.	I-Review	I-1	Review	10099
Could you comment on using categorical features as well?	I-Review	I-1	Review	10099
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The method is clearly explained and references are appropriate, so most of my questions relate to the empirical setup and results.	O	O	Review	10099
[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, it seems to me that the paper would be much stronger if you were to reproduce the results from an established paper.	B-Review	B-2	Review	10099
If you take the catboost paper (arXiv:1706.09516v5 [cs.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10099
LG] 20 Jan 2019), the error on epsilon dataset is 10.9 which is better than the number your report, similarly click reports 15.6 error rate.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10099
To me, the paper would be much better if you simply added an FCNN and a NODE column to Table 2 and 3 of the catboost paper.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10099
It does not mean that your approach has to be better in all cases, but it will give a clear picture of when it is useful and it would clear any doubt on the tuning of the catboost baseline.	I-Review	I-2	Review	10099
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Second, the model you propose builds upon the densenet idea while the FCNN you compare with has no densenet connections.	B-Review	B-3	Review	10099
It would be fairer to consider neural net with this kind of residual.	I-Review	I-3	Review	10099
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Third, I feel you need to report results over CPU as well.	B-Review	B-4	Review	10099
Boosted trees primary advantage is their low cost on regular CPU, the entmax formulation requires integrating over more leaves [line_break_token]than typical thresholded trees and it would be interesting to compare the effect on CPU.	I-Review	I-4	Review	10099
Reporting timing with batch and individual sample evaluation would make sense as well.	I-Review	I-4	Review	10099
[line_break_token][line_break_token] As a side note, I would advise to define entmax with its equation.	B-Review	B-5	Review	10099
It is too recent to consider it should be known by the reader.	I-Review	I-5	Review	10099
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, this is a good paper than reads well.	O	O	Review	10099
The method is novel, interesting and practical.	O	O	Review	10099
With the extra experiments, it would make an excellent ICLR paper.	O	O	Review	10099

This paper discusses the old problem of mismatch between the ultimate reward obtained after optimizing a  decision (planning or control) over a probabilistic model (of dynamics) and  the training  objective for the model (log-likelihood).	O	O	Review	20440
Experiments highlight that the NLL and reward can be very poorly correlated, that improvements in NLL initially improve reward but can later degrade it, and that models with similar NLLs can lead to very different rewards.	O	O	Review	20440

[line_break_token][line_break_token]I like the topic of this paper but there are several aspects which I see as making it weaker than my acceptance threshold.	O	O	Review	20440
[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, the paper overclaims in originality.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20440
This mismatch problem is not new, it is an instance of a more general issue that end-to-end training and meta-learning try to address, and has been already studied in the context of MBRL by many authors, who actually proposed more substantial solutions.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20440
When I read the abstract I had the impression that the paper actually had a theoretical analysis showing the correlation problem, but there is no such thing, only experiments.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20440
Section 3 does not actually provide a new insight.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20440
Still, the experiments are interesting in that they reveal that the magnitude of the mismatch is probably more serious than most RL researchers believed.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20440
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Second, the 'fix' proposed is not well justified nor well tested (e.g. no quantiative comparisons, no comparisons against existing alternative methods to address the same problem, etc).	B-Review	B-2	Review	20440
This seriously weakens conclusions like "shows improvements in sample efficiency".	I-Review	I-2	Review	20440
[line_break_token][line_break_token]One concern I have about the experiments of fig 3 is that NLL can be really bad, thus distorting rho, which is not a robust measure.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20440
So I would only look at NLLs of models with good NLLs, to obtain a more interesting analysis.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20440
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Another concern about experiments is that I am not convinced that they were performed with SOTA MBRL methods and hyper-parameters (as demonstrated by SOTA performance on known benchmarks).	B-Review	B-4	Review	20440
Otherwise I could easily imagine how the mismatch could be much more severe than in the actual scenarios of interest.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20440

This paper introduces MusicNet, a new dataset.	O	O	Review	266
Application of ML techniques to music have been limited due to scarcity of exactly the kind of data that is provided here: meticulously annotated, carefully verified and organized, containing enough "hours" of music, and where genre has been well constrained in order to allow for sufficient homogeneity in the data to help ensure usefulness.

The paper introduces a new dataset called MusicNet (presumably analogous to ImageNet), featuring dense ground truth labels for 30+ hours of classical music, which is provided as raw audio.	O	O	Review	266
Such a dataset is extremely valuable for music information retrieval (MIR) research and a dataset of this size has never before been publicly available.	O	O	Review	266
It has the potential to dramatically increase the impact of modern machine learning techniques (e.g. deep learning) in this field, whose adoption has previously been hampered by a lack of available datasets that are large enough.	O	O	Review	266
The paper is clear and well-written.	O	O	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper also features some "example" experiments using the dataset, which I am somewhat less excited about.	O	O	Review	266
The authors decided to focus on one single task that is not particularly challenging: identifying pitches in isolated segments of audio.	O	O	Review	266
Pitch information is a fairly low-level characteristic of music.	O	O	Review	266
Considering that isolated fragments are used as input, this is a relatively simple problem that probably doesn't even require machine learning to solve adequately, e.g. peak picking on a spectral representation could already get you pretty far.	O	O	Review	266
It's not clear what value the machine learning component in the proposed approach actually adds, if any.	O	O	Review	266
I could be wrong about this as I haven't done the comparison myself, but I think the burden is on the authors to demonstrate that using ML here is actually useful.	O	O	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I would argue that one of the strenghts of the dataset is the variety of label information it provides, so a much more convincing setup would have been to demonstrate many different prediction tasks for both low-level (e.g. pitch, onsets) and high-level (e.g. composer) characteristics, perhaps with fewer and simpler models -- maybe even sticking to spectrogram input and forgoing raw audio input for the time being, as this comparison seems orthogonal to the introduction of the dataset itself.	O	O	Review	266
As it stands, I feel that the fact that the experiments are relatively uninteresting detracts from the main point of the paper, which is to introduce a new public dataset that is truly unique in terms of its scale and scope.	O	O	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token]That said, the experiments seem to have been conducted in a rigorous fashion and the evaluation and analysis of the resulting models is properly executed.	O	O	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Re: Section 4.5, it is rather unsurprising to me that a pitch detector would learn filters that resemble pitches (i.e. sinusoids), although the observation that this requires a relatively large amount of data is interesting.	B-Review	B-2	Review	266
However, it would be more interesting to demonstrate that this is also the case for higher-level tasks.	I-Review	I-2	Review	266
The authors favourably compare the features learnt by their model with prior work on end-to-end learning from raw audio, but neglect that the tasks considered in this work were much more high-level.	I-Review	I-2	Review	266

Summary:[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper presents a new set of metrics for evaluating disentangled representations in both supervised and unsupervised settings.	O	O	Review	266
Disentangled representations are evaluated along three dimensions: informativeness, separability, and interpretability.	O	O	Review	266
While previous work offers metrics for similar dimensions (e.g., (Eastwood &amp; Williams, 2018)), the paper suggests that the metrics of the submission are superior to (Eastwood &amp; Williams, 2018), based on a comparison between FactorVAE and Beta-VAE.	O	O	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Strengths:[line_break_token][line_break_token](1) The metrics of the paper are well motivated from an information-theoretic standpoint.	O	O	Review	266
While, in some cases, the metrics themselves are straight applications of information theory (e.g., informativeness metric == mutual information), the authors came up with new metrics when existing information-theoretic definitions could be fooled by, e.g., introducing noisy and independent latent representations z.[line_break_token][line_break_token](2) Experimental results show that these metrics are better than previous metrics at discriminating between FactorVAE and Beta-VAE (in an experimental setting where the former is clearly superior to the latter).	O	O	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token](3) As opposed to much of prior work, these metrics do not require any training, which can be considered a plus as they do not require adaptation for each (sub)domain.	O	O	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token](4) The paper is overall well written and clear.	O	O	Review	266
I very much enjoyed reading it.	O	O	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Weaknesses:[line_break_token][line_break_token](1) My main concern with the paper, which makes me vote for ‚Äúweak accept‚Äù instead of ‚Äúaccept‚Äù: The metrics of the paper are compared against previous metrics (Eastwood &amp; Williams, 2018) on *only two* types of disentangled representations, namely FactorVAE and Beta-VAE, and in one experimental condition. (	O	O	Review	266
There is plenty of other experimental material in the appendix which also introduces AAE, but none of it seems to compare against previous *metrics*).	B-Review	B-1	Review	266
I think comparing metrics on only two systems is somewhat problematic, and we don‚Äôt know how general the results are.	I-Review	I-1	Review	266
I would have preferred to see FactorVAE and Beta-VAE evaluated with fewer hyperparameter choices to allow introducing more variational approaches.	I-Review	I-1	Review	266
Could you (the authors) at least evaluate AAE against Eastwood &amp; Williams too?	O	O	Review	266
This concern is not just mere quibbling, as the authors have shown (e.g., in Section 3.2) that specific edge cases can fool na√Øve metrics (e.g., by introducing noisy and independent latent variables), and there may be other edge cases that the authors have not considered.	B-Review	B-1	Review	266
I think evaluating new metrics against previous work (i.e., metrics) on only two underlying systems is not very convincing.	I-Review	I-1	Review	266
I acknowledge that the paper offers *lots* of experiments ‚Äì the full pdf is 30 pages (!) ‚	I-Review	I-1	Review	266
Äì but I think some of the existing ones could go to leave space for evaluations using more underlying VAE/baselines/edge-case systems.	I-Review	I-1	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token](2) The paper presents six metrics (MI, MISJED, WSEPIN, WINDIN, RMIG, JEMMIG) along three dimensions.	B-Review	B-2	Review	266
While each individual metric makes sense, I feel the paper lacks a discussion section that ties these pieces together and suggests a way of using these metrics conjointly across the three dimensions towards building better-disentangled representations (the paper has a ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù section, but it is very short and actually more of a conclusion).	I-Review	I-2	Review	266
The more metrics we have, the more chances each underlying VAE model can ‚Äúwin‚Äù on one of the metrics, which is not particularly enlightening.	I-Review	I-2	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token](3) The paper is not self-contained, and some parts are almost impossible to understand without familiarity with (Kim &amp; Mnih, 2018) and (Higgins et al 2017a).	O	O	Review	266
It uses technical terms of these papers without explanations (e.g., TC is not even spelled out it seems).	B-Review	B-3	Review	266
Hyperparameters of these papers (e.g., beta, gamma) are used without explanation.	I-Review	I-3	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token](4) There is no related work section.	B-Review	B-4	Review	266
Such a section could, e.g., make what is borrowed from (Kim &amp; Mnih, 2018; Higgins et al 2017a) more understandable.	O	O	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, I think it is a nice paper that makes significant contributions to the problem of building better disentangles representations thanks to better evaluation metrics.	O	O	Review	266
The empirical support for some of the claims (e.g., superiority to (Eastwood &amp; Williams, 2018)) is a bit weak, but other strengths mentioned above largely make up for that.	O	O	Review	266
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor comments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]The definitions of SEPIN@k and INDIN@k don‚Äôt seem quite right.	B-Review	B-5	Review	266
The summation iterates over z_0, ‚Ä¶, z_k-1, leaving off z_k, ‚Ä¶, z_L-1, but the latter variables might contain some z‚Äôs with lowest mutual information with x. The way the ‚Äòsorted‚Äô function is written only has the effect of reordering z_0, ‚Ä¶, z_{k-1} among themselves, never considering any of the z_k and above whatever their MI‚Äôs are, which is probably not what the authors meant.	I-Review	I-5	Review	266
Perhaps ‚Äòsorted‚Äô is intended to both sort and rename z‚Äôs, but if z‚Äôs are indeed renamed I think this should be indicated mathematically otherwise the equation is wrong (e.g., (z‚Äô_1, ‚Ä¶, z‚Äô_{L-1}) = sorted_by_MI(z_1, ‚Ä¶, z_{L_1})).	I-Review	I-5	Review	266

This paper defines precise semantics&nbsp;of disentanglement representations and presents evaluation metrics to evaluate such representations.	O	O	Review	266
The authors provides information-theoretic characterization disentangled representations along three dimensions: informativeness, separability, and interpretability; and propose metrics to measure them.	O	O	Review	266
The authors argue that:- Informativeness can be defined as the mutual information&nbsp;between a particular representation (or a group of representations) w.r.t the data---I(x,z_i)&nbsp;- Separability between two representations can be achieved if they do not share any common information about the data---I(x,z_i,z_j) = 0&nbsp;- Interpretability with respect to a concept is achieved if a representation contains information about the concept---I(z_i, y_k) = H(z_i) = H(y_k).The authors define a disentangled representation as a representation that is fully separable and fully interpretable and propose a suite of metrics to evaluate disentangled representations.	O	O	Review	266
Finally, the authors evaluate several representation learning methods (FactorVAE, betaVAE, AAE) using these metrics on toy and real datasets.	O	O	Review	266

Extensive experiments on advanced networks/datasets[line_break_token][line_break_token]In our paper we use the same networks as the previous work (Gowal et al 2018), to stay comparable with their results, which we call DM-Small, DM-Medium, and DM-Large.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20116
During the preparation of this submission, we tried much wider networks by increasing the width of the DM-Large model twice and four times, but they did not yield significant performance improvement.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
Thus we decided to keep models the same as in previous work for a straightforward comparison.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
We plan to implement more advanced networks (e.g., ResNet, DenseNet, etc) as the next step and scale to larger datasets is our future work.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Besides the three models presented in the submitted version of the paper, in this revision, we additionally provide more comprehensive experiments on a large range of MNIST and CIFAR-10 models (18 MNIST models + 17 CIFAR models).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
The purpose of this experiment is to compare model performance statistics (min, median, and max) on a wide range of models, rather than a few hand-selected models.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
The results are presented in Appendix F, Table D. On all model structures and parameter settings, CROWN-IBP can outperform IBP in terms of best, median and worst verified errors.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
Especially, in many situations, the worst-case verified error improves significantly using CROWN-IBP because IBP training is not stable on some of the models.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116

[line_break_token][line_break_token](Q3).	O	O	Reply	20116
Breakdown of the cost between different layers and operations:[line_break_token][line_break_token]The per-layer cost for propagating the CROWN-IBP bound backward is actually quite simple: in a high level, for all operations in the neural network, it is times  is the number of classes, for MNIST/CIFAR it is 10) more expensive than forward propagation as there are specifications per example.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20116
Thus CROWN-IBP is well suited to problems where the number of classes is small (more classes can be done efficiently by subsampling of specifications, which is left to future work).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20116
CROWN-IBP is significantly more efficient than CROWN (Zhang et al 2018) and convex adversarial polytope (Wong et al 2018); it is times faster than these approaches, where is the number of layers and is hidden layer size.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20116
Generally, (ordinary) CROWN and convex adversarial polytopes are too slow for training.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20116
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Practically, CROWN-IBP training time can be much less than times slower than IBP, as CROWN-IBP is typically only used during the epsilon schedule rather than the entire training process, and CROWN-IBP generally executes more efficiently than IBP on parallel hardware because it packs denser computation that utilizes hardware accelerators better.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20116
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Empirically, we have further optimized the implementation of CROWN-IBP (with roughly 2X reduction in training time in Table G), and we have prepared a multi-GPU version that can train the largest CIFAR-10 model in about 1 day using 4 GPUs.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20116

[line_break_token]However, it can be hard to tune due to its very imprecise bound at the beginning of training; on the[line_break_token]other hand, linear relaxation based methods give tighter lower bounds which stabilize training, but it[line_break_token]over-regularizes the network and forbids us to achieve good accuracy."

This paper proposes a new method for training certifiably robust models that achieves better results than the previous SOTA results by IBP, with a moderate increase in training time.	O	O	Review	20116
It uses a CROWN-based bound in the warm up phase of IBP, which serves as a better initialization for the later phase of IBP and lead to improvements in both robust and standard accuracy.	O	O	Review	20116
The CROWN-based bound uses IBP to compute bounds for intermediate pre-activations and applies CROWN only to computing the bounds of the margins, which has a complexity between IBP and CROWN.	O	O	Review	20116
The experimental results are verify detailed to demonstrate the improvement.	O	O	Review	20116
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The improvement is significant enough to me and I tend to accept the paper.	O	O	Review	20116
The results on CIFAR10 with epsilon=8/255 is so far the state-of-the-art.	O	O	Review	20116
However, it is far from being scalable enough to large networks and datasets, which has already been achieved by randomized smoothing based approaches.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20116
On CIFAR10, it takes 32 TPU cores to train a 4-conv-layer network.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20116
Still, such an approach has the advantage of making robust inferences much more efficiently than randomized smoothing, and thus still worth further explorations.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20116
ear AnonReviewer2,[line_break_token][line_break_token]We thank you for recognizing the contributions of our paper and raising the discussions on randomized smoothing and concerns on expensive computations on TPUs.	O	O	Reply	20116
[line_break_token][line_break_token](Answer 1) Compared to the randomized smoothing based method, our bound propagation-based approach has several theoretical and practical benefits:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20116
Recent works [1][2] show that randomized smoothing may not scale well for the important case of L infinity robustness.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
They provided some preliminary theoretical evidence that even the *optimal* robustness certificate for L infinity smoothing has a dependency on dimension d, thus for high dimensional input (e.g., CIFAR with d=3072), randomized smoothing based method cannot give a good quality bound.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
On the other hand, for L2 norm, the randomized smoothing certificate is dimension-free.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
This is a fundamental limitation of randomized smoothing.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
For the L infinity setting like CIFAR epsilon=8/255, bound propagation-based method like CROWN-IBP still gives the best results.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
As also mentioned by the reviewer, randomized smoothing typically needs a large number of samples, e.g., in Cohen et al 100,000 random samples for a *single* image.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
In contrast, our verification can be computed using IBP very fast, which is only 2x forward propagation time.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
Randomized smoothing costs 50,000x more during inference, and our training procedure is 500x (pessimistically) slower during training time.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
So it is really a trade-off here; each method has its own strength.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Being scalable to large networks on all important norms with less training/inference cost is still an open challenge.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
It is not solved by randomized smoothing, nor CROWN-IBP.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
For the next step, our future work will investigate how to combine the strengths from bound propagation-based certified defense (good for L infinity norm, sample free) and randomized smoothing based approach (good for L2 norm, need a lot of samples).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
Thus, our contribution as the SOTA bound propagation-based certified defense is important, as it can become an ingredient of the next generation certified defense.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
[line_break_token][line_break_token](Answer 2) Regarding computation cost, the use of 32 TPUs is not necessary.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
We use TPUs mainly for obtaining a completely fair comparison to IBP (Gowal et al, 2018), as their implementation was TPU-based.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
We additionally implemented CROWN-IBP using multi-GPUs.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
Training the same largest CIFAR network takes 1 day on 4x 1080 Ti GPUs (using the same hyperparameters), and we can achieve similar accuracy.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
We think this computational cost is quite reasonable, compared to other SOTA uncertified defense like adversarial training, which is also quite slow (10-20x extra cost for each epoch, and needs much more epochs to converge than natural training).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We updated new multi-GPU training results in Table H, and we will open source our multi-GPU training code to make our algorithm available to a broader audience.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20116

This paper proposes a simple method for stabilizing the off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which updates the target network only when the online network performs better than the target network in order to ensure the stability guarantees.	O	O	Review	20009
More specifically, at every T time steps, they execute both the online network and the target network so as to evaluate the performance of each policy.	O	O	Review	20009
Then, they update the target network only when the online network outperforms the target network with high probability.	O	O	Review	20009
The experimental results show that the proposed Conservative-TD3 (C-TD3) is less prone to performance degradation during training.	O	O	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While the stabilizing off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms would be a significant problem, I have some concerns regarding the presentation and the limitation of the proposed method.	B-Review	B-6	Review	20009
[line_break_token]- In p2, 'Value Iteration and Policy Iteration are algorithms for solving tabular RL tasks with convergence guarantee': Basically, exact value iteration and policy iteration are MDP 'planning' algorithms, NOT reinforcement learning algorithms.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20009
VI and PI assume 'known' transition and reward dynamics thus there is no need to learn anything, while RL basically assumes the 'unknown' environment thus the agent should learn by doing.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20009
[line_break_token]- Algorithm 1, 2, 3 and 4 are not directly related to the proposed method, thus they can be omitted from the paper.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20009
Instead, it would be great to devote more space to the proposed method such as a more detailed theoretical analysis or the pseudo-code of the proposed algorithm.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20009
[line_break_token]- It seems that the performance of the online and target networks is evaluated by Monte-Carlo return which is obtained by executing each policy in the real environment.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20009
This requires additional direct interaction with the environment, which can severely hurt the sample complexity of the algorithm.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20009
In Figure 4, does the x-axis of C-TD3 reflect these additional samples for evaluating the performance of two policies?	I-Review	I-3	Review	20009
[line_break_token]- The abstract says 'our proposed method reduces the variance of the process and improves the overall performance'.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20009
This claim is too strong.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20009
If we see Figure 4, in Walker2d, the mean performance of TD3 reaches 4000 at 400k steps, while the performance of C-TD3 is even less than 3000.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20009
Similarly in HalfCheetah and Ant, the asymptotic performance of TD3 is higher than C-TD3.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20009
It would be great to show the learning curves of TD3 and C-TD3 overlapped.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20009
[line_break_token]- In the experiments, 'discarding failure seeds' cannot be a proper treatment.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20009
Instead of discarding the bad results, the reliable algorithm had to be proposed.	I-Review	I-5	Review	20009

[line_break_token]- Theory: The goal of the theoretical analysis was to provide intuition.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20009
Intuitively, as the probability of improvement increases, then the stable distribution will place more probability mass at being at a higher value.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20009
[line_break_token]- Pseudocode: As the approach is not complex, we believe that the flow-chart is easier to comprehend, thus we provided the pseudocode in the appendix.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20009
However, if we do end up removing Alg.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20009
1-4 in the rewrite, we will follow this advice and place it in the main portion of the paper.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20009
[line_break_token]- Evaluation: Indeed the evaluation is performed using Monte Carlo sampling.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	20009
Just as you have stated this leads to additional environment interactions, we will make sure this is clearer.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20009
The X axis in this case corresponds to the number of gradient steps.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20009
In our opinion, these are intruiging results which give motivation for further research - for instance find ways to perform off-policy policy evaluation in order to determine which policy is better, i.e., removing the additional environment interactions.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	20009
[line_break_token]- Claim: We will tune down the claim.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	20009
While the results did reduce variance across all domains and the asymptotic performance across almost all domains was matched/improved, indeed this is not in all domains and the abstract should reflect these results.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20009
[line_break_token]- Failure seeds: We also feel somewhat uncomfortable with this approach, but we believe it is better to be up-front rather than hiding it.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	20009
These failure seeds occurred both in the C-TD3 and TD3, at a similar frequency, where TD3 is the original code provided by the papers authors; as such, since both algorithms received the same "care" and since this is not the focus of our work, we believe that this approach yields a fair comparison	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	20009

[line_break_token][Summary][line_break_token]This paper proposes an approach called conservative policy gradients to stabilize the training of deep policy gradient methods.	O	O	Review	20009
At fixed intervals, the current policy and a separate target policy are evaluated with a number of rollouts.	O	O	Review	20009
The target policy is then updated to match the current policy only if the current policy is better than the target policy.	O	O	Review	20009
Experiments show that the proposed method, when applied to TD3, reduces the variance in performance through the training.	O	O	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Decision][line_break_token]I am not convinced that the proposed method is sound and indeed useful and I vote for rejecting this paper.	B-Review	B-8	Review	20009
Experiments show stable performance.	I-Review	I-8	Review	20009
However, this stability comes at the cost of extra computation and interaction with the environment (to evaluate the policies).	I-Review	I-8	Review	20009
Claims about the method's stability guarantees and overall performance are not supported by theory and experiments.	I-Review	I-8	Review	20009
The submitted paper also needs major improvements in presentation.	I-Review	I-8	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token][Explanation][line_break_token]While Proposition 1 provides insights on how the policy evolves, it is too limited to serve as a guarantee.	B-Review	B-7	Review	20009
First, performance does not improve or degrade by a constant number.	I-Review	I-7	Review	20009
Second, the time it takes for the policy to improve is not captured by the theory.	I-Review	I-7	Review	20009
In reality, this time can depend on the hyperparameters or the policy's current performance and might even be unbounded.	I-Review	I-7	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I do not understand why a characterization of the performance in the limit of time in Proposition 1 is called a stability guarantee while in the rest of the paper stability refers to consistent improvements in the interim performance.	B-Review	B-6	Review	20009
Does stability in this proposition mean that the performance will reach a stationary distribution with bounded support?	I-Review	I-6	Review	20009
This property is merely a result of the assumptions that the performance evolves by a constant number at bounded times and that it does not exceed [v_min,v_max].[line_break_token][line_break_token]The theory studies the stationary distribution of the target policy's performance but the algorithm uses the online policy to interact with the environment.	B-Review	B-5	Review	20009
In Algorithm 5, line 8 (Section D in the Appendix) the target policy is only used for bootstrapping.	I-Review	I-5	Review	20009
How can a stable target policy result in more stable performance if it is not used to take actions?	I-Review	I-5	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper claims that the proposed method results in improvements in stability and overall performance.	I-Review	I-5	Review	20009
In Figure 3, the proposed method is more stable than the baseline but the overall performance is not better.	I-Review	I-5	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The proposed method requires more computation and interaction with the environment than the baseline.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20009
The experiments do not seem to compare these two methods with the same number of samples or with the same amount of computation.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20009
Perhaps the extra computation and samples are better spent on training TD3 for a longer time.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I find Section 2 hard to follow.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20009
This section describes Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, DQN, and DDPG in detail (with pseudocode) along with their convergence rates.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20009
The message that deep RL algorithms generally lack theoretical guarantees can be conveyed by just describing the linear and deep variants of one method.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20009
In fact, the algorithm whose stability is analyzed in the next sections, TD3, is not described in Section 2 or anywhere else in the paper.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Later in Section 3, DDPG and DQN are described as off-policy Deep RL variants of Value Iteration and Policy Iteration.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20009
DQN and DDPG are actually built on Q-learning and Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG).	I-Review	I-3	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token][Minor comments][line_break_token]In the learning curves in Figure 1, what is the measure of performance and how is it estimated?	B-Review	B-4	Review	20009
A description of the plotted measure is necessary to show that the drops in the estimated performance are indeed due to policy degradation rather than poor estimation.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]--------------------[line_break_token]After rebuttal: I have read the authors' response, the other reviews, and the revision.	O	O	Review	20009
The revised version has improved presentation, but the proposed method is still introduced as a method with stability guarantees while the proposition in the paper cannot serve as a stability guarantee, and can only provide intuition on the asymptotic performance.	B-Review	B-6	Review	20009
[line_break_token]	O	O	Review	20009
hank you for your thorough review.	O	O	Reply	20009
We will address your points below:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Proposition: Indeed as you have mentioned, the Proposition analyzes the asymptotic performance.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	20009
The goal is to provide intuition - by performing these evaluations and ensuring that there is a high enough probability of improvement, the policy is more likely to continue improving and achieve a stable solution.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	20009
This is in contrast to other deep rl approaches which are highly unstable.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Stability: The target policy is used both as a stable measure for training the critic and at line 13,14 when the policies are evaluated and swapped if needed.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	20009
Line 8 is also the approach in TD3/DDPG, and as we show in the preliminaries it is inspired by policy iteration techniques.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Results: While our approach did not improve the mean performance across all domains, this is the case in most of them.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	20009
Hopper, Inverted Pendulum, Inverted Double Pendulum and Walker saw improvement both in mean performance and in variance reduction.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	20009
HalfCheetah is slightly worse.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	20009
And indeed in Ant we saw a reduction in performance.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Computation: In Figure 3, the X axis denotes the number of gradient steps.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	20009
We will also add simulations for TD3 with a longer training regime, to demonstrate that even with a similar number of samples, our approach improves the overall performance.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Section 2: This is also a remark we received from the other reviewers - one which we intend to fix.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	20009
We will rewrite this section in order to make it clearer.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20009
As you noted, DQN and DDPG are derived from Q-learning and DPG, but their origins go further back to VI/PI.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Figure 1: The performance in all our graphs was estimated over 100 episodes.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	20009
Meaning, each 1,000 steps we evaluate the policy for 100 episodes and plot the average performance (per seed).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20009
As previous works performed either a single evaluation or 10, we see it as highly unlikely that these drops occur due to poor estimation.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	20009

This paper proposed to use target network policy as a conservative policy for performance evaluation.	O	O	Review	20009
Instead of performing Polyak averaging on the target network, the authors proposed to utilize statistical hypothesis testing to check whether the performance of the online policy is better than the target network policy and update the target network policy according to the results of the hypothesis testing.	O	O	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper is clear written and easy to follow the core idea.	O	O	Review	20009
As for the experiments, the authors evaluate the proposed method on a variant of TD3 (Conservative-TD3) and the experimental results indicate the proposed method indeed reduces the variance of the expected return.	O	O	Review	20009
Ablation studies has been provided in the appendix to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	O	O	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Besides the promising results, I believe there are several concerns that should be clarified before we can conclude that the proposed method can improve the stability.	O	O	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Stability Measurement: While the experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the variance of expected return, it is not a direct measurement of the stability or the robustness of the learned policy.	B-Review	B-1	Review	20009
It is better to show whether the proposed method can satisfy stability or robustness definition of RL algorithms. (	I-Review	I-1	Review	20009
For example, whether the proposed method can improve the robustness: Given a policy, by adding a \epsilon perturbation to the input, the output is still \epsilon-robustness) Otherwise, the author should add some discussion to clarify the difference.	I-Review	I-1	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Conservative Updates on Q functions.	B-Review	B-2	Review	20009
In Actor critic frameworks such as DDPG or TD3, the performance of the actor is usually determined by the critic.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20009
The proposed method is more likely to ‚Äúselect‚Äù stable actors rather than directly improving the stable of the training process or the stability of the policy.	I-Review	I-2	Review	20009
I wonder whether it is possible to improve the stability of Q updates such that the ‚Äúselection‚Äù process of policy can be easier, which may accelerate the current training process (or making the hypothesis easier to satisfy).	I-Review	I-2	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- More related work should be compared.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20009
The authors only compare the original version of TD3 and the modified proposed method.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20009
Other recent proposed methods to improve stability should be compared in the experiments, such as Constrained Policy Optimization (Achiam et.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20009
al 2017), Lypunov-based Safe Policy methods (such as Chow et.	I-Review	I-3	Review	20009
al 2019).	I-Review	I-3	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Noisy Environment.	B-Review	B-4	Review	20009
The authors demonstrate the stability of the proposed method in the ordinary mujoco benchmarks.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20009
How does the proposed method perform in the noisy MDP settings?	I-Review	I-4	Review	20009
Since the original Mujoco implementation is deterministic, the experiments that the author conducted are not enough to show the proposed method can generalize to more realistic settings such as noisy MDPs.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20009
It would be more convincing if the method can still perform well in such settings to support the claim.	I-Review	I-4	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall I think the authors proposed a simple but yet effective method to improve the stability of policy, while the current paper requires more comparison with other methods and more challenging settings to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	B-Review	B-3	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token]--------------------------------[line_break_token]I will update my score if the author clarify above questions.	O	O	Review	20009
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]-------------------------------[line_break_token]The author clarified one of my main concern, but the other reviewers point out that the comparison is not fair (using only 5 seeds and discarding the failure seeds).	B-Review	B-5	Review	20009

[line_break_token][line_break_token]ABOUT THE NOVELTY: [line_break_token][line_break_token]Although traditional QA systems also have the answer re-ranking component, this paper focuses on a novel problem of ``text evidence aggregation'': Here the problem is essentially modeling the relationship between the question and multiple passages (i.e., text evidence), where different passages could enhance or complement each other.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	254
For example,  the proposed neural re-ranker models the complementary scenario, i.e., whether the union of different passages could cover different facts in a question, thus the attention-based model is a natural fit.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In contrast, previous answer re-ranking research did not address the above problem: (1) traditional QA systems like (Ferrucci et al 2010) used similar passage retrieval approach with answer candidates added to the queries.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
However they usually consider each passage individually for extracting features of answers, whereas we utilize the information of union/co-occurrence of multiple passages by composing them with neural networks. (	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
2) KB-QA systems (Bast and Haussmann, 2015; Yih et al 2015; Xu et al 2016) sometimes use text evidence to help answer re-ranking, where the features are also extracted on the pair of a question and a single-passage but ignored the union information among multiple passages.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254

In summary, the BM25 model improved the F1 scores but sometimes caused a decrease in the EM scores.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	254
 This is mainly for two reasons: (1) BM25 relies on bag-of-word representation, so context information is not taken into consideration.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	254

2) shorter answers are preferred by BM25.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	254

[line_break_token][line_break_token]================================================[line_break_token][line_break_token]At a high level, the paper considers how to sort a number of items without explicitly necessarily learning their actual meanings or values.	O	O	Review	254
Permutations are discrete combinatorial objects, so the paper proposes a method to perform the optimization via a continuous relaxation.	O	O	Review	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This is an important problem to sort items, arising in a variety of applications, particularly when the direct sorting can be more efficient than the two step approach of computing the values and then sorting.	O	O	Review	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I like both the theoretical parts and the experimental results.	O	O	Review	254
In the context of ICLR, the specific theoretical modules comprise some cute results (Theorem 4; use of past works in Lemma 2 and Proposition 5).	O	O	Review	254

The empirical evaluations show quite good results.	O	O	Review	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]However, I had a hard time parsing the paper.	B-Review	B-1	Review	254
The paper is written in a manner that may be accessible to readers who are familiar with this (or similar) line of research, but for someone like me who is not, I found it quite hard to understand the arguments (or lack of them) made in the paper connecting various modules.	I-Review	I-1	Review	254
Here are some examples:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Section 6.1 states "Each sequence contains n images, and each image corresponds to an integer label.	B-Review	B-2	Review	254
Our goal is to learn to predict the permutation that sorts these labels".	I-Review	I-2	Review	254
One interpretation of this statement suggests that each row of Fig 3a is a sequence, that each sequence contains n=4 images (e.g., 4 images corresponding to each digit in 2960), and the goal is to sort [2960] to [0269]. However, according to the response of authors to my earlier comment, the goal is to sort [2960,1270,9803] to [1270,2960,9803]. [line_break_token][line_break_token]- I did not understand Section 2.2.	B-Review	B-3	Review	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- I would appreciate a more detailed background on the concrete goal before going into the techniques of section 3 and 4.	B-Review	B-4	Review	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- I am having a hard time in connecting the experiments in Section 6 with the theory described in earlier sections.	B-Review	B-5	Review	254
And this is so even after my clarifying questions to the authors and their responses.	I-Review	I-5	Review	254
For instance, the authors explained that the experiments in Section 6.1 have \theta as vacuous and that the function f represents the cross-entropy loss between permutation z and the true permutation matrix.	I-Review	I-5	Review	254
Then where is this true permutation matrix captured as an argument of f in (6)?	I-Review	I-5	Review	254

In many machine learning applications, sorting is an important step such as ranking.	O	O	Review	254
However, the sorting operator is not differentiable with respect to its inputs.	O	O	Review	254

For completeness, we address the two questions specifically raised by the reviewer here:[line_break_token][line_break_token]In all our experiments, we are dealing with sequences of n objects x = [x1, x2, ‚Ä¶, xn] and trying to sort these objects for an end goal.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
In Section 6.1, the goal is to output the sorted permutation for a sequence of n largeMNIST images; in 6.2, the goal is to output the median value in the sequence; in 6.3, the goal is to sort a sequence of training points as per their distances to a query point for kNN classification.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254

In the experiments in Section 6.1, the function f is the element-wise cross-entropy loss between the true permutation matrix that sorts x and P_z.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
Again for the purpose of generality , we do not explicitly include the ground-truth permutation as an argument to the function f in Equation (7) since such objectives also arise in unsupervised settings, e.g., latent variable modeling where there is no ground-truth label.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
[line_break_token]- The parameters \theta for specifying f as a function of P_z are optional and task-specific.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
In particular, the cross-entropy loss function f for experiments in Section 6.1 does not needs any additional parameters \theta.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
For the experiments in Section 6.2, we cannot compute a loss directly with respect to the permutation matrix P_z since we need to regress a scalar value for the median.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
Instead, we feed the predicted median image in the input sequence (can be obtained via sorting x as per P_z) to a neural network (with parameters \theta) to obtain a real-valued, scalar prediction.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
We then compute f as the the MSE regression loss between the true median value and the value predicted by the parameterized neural network.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254

The authors propose several approaches to making a data-to-text generation system more precise, that is, less prone to hallucination.	O	O	Review	254
 In particular, they propose an attention score, which attempts to measure to what degree the model is relying on its attention mechanism in making a prediction.	O	O	Review	254
This attention score is used to weight a mixture distribution (a "confidence score") over the generation model's next-word distribution and the next-word distribution of an unconditional language model.	O	O	Review	254
The learned conditional distribution can then be calibrated to the confidence score.	O	O	Review	254
The authors also propose a variational-inference inspired objective, which attempts to allow the model to ignore certain tokens it isn't confident about.	O	O	Review	254
The authors evaluate their approach on the WikiBio dataset, and find that their approaches make their system more precise, at the cost of some coverage.	O	O	Review	254

In particular:[line_break_token][line_break_token]-  What justifies defining the attention score A_t in this way?	B-Review	B-1	Review	254
First, is there an argument (empirical or otherwise) for using the magnitude of the attention vector (rather than some other statistic)?	I-Review	I-1	Review	254
Is it obvious that if the attention vector has a high magnitude then it ought to be trusted?	I-Review	I-1	Review	254
Note that this might be a reasonable assumption in the case of a pointer-generator style model, where a single attention vector is used both for attending and for copying, but in a model where attention isn't constrained in this way the magnitude of the attention vector may be misleading.

First, I don't understand what it means for p(y | z, x) to be assumed to 1.	I-Review	I-2	Review	254
Is this for any z (in which case y is independent of z)?	I-Review	I-2	Review	254
Otherwise, how can it be removed from the objective? (	I-Review	I-2	Review	254
Put another way: Equation (17) is not in general true; it neglects an expected log likelihood term).	I-Review	I-2	Review	254
I'm also not entirely clear on how Equation (12) is modeled: do the z's really only rely on the other sampled z's?	B-Review	B-5	Review	254
Doesn't that require a different model than the one that calculates P^{\kappa}?	B-Review	B-6	Review	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Somewhat minor: the claim that optimizing the joint objective needn't hurt perplexity relies on kappa being 0; have you confirmed empirically that when it isn't zero the perplexity improves over the baseline model?	B-Review	B-3	Review	254

[line_break_token][line_break_token]&gt; What justifies defining the attention score A_t in this way?	O	O	Reply	254
Is it obvious that if the attention vector has a high magnitude then it ought to be trusted?	O	O	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The attention score A_t measures how much the model actually relies on the source to make a prediction.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	254
Since the context vector v_t is defined as a_t + h_t in Equation (2), defining A_t in this way as a magnitude ratio measures how much a_t affects v_t.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
In practice, A_t is usually high (~0.9) when the model is copying from the source (e.g. ‚ÄúCampbell‚Äù in Figure 2), medium (~0.4) when the model is generating based on some information from the source (e.g. ‚Äú&lt;unk&gt;‚Äù in Figure 2), and low (~0.2) when the model is generating template elements (e.g. ‚Äúis‚Äù in Figure 2).	O	O	Reply	254
More examples are added to our revised paper.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	254
This observation does not immediately mean that a generation with higher attention score should be trusted; whether to trust a token or not is assessed by the confidence score.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
We will discuss this next.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Our confidence score depends on both the attention score and generation probabilities.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
The idea of our confidence score was originated from an observation on baseline predictions of Wikibio: Hallucination often occurs when the table lacks some field that usually exists, for example the ‚ÄúOccupation‚Äù field is missing in Figure 1, and the baseline model makes that up.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
In such cases, the conditioned generation probability can still be high (e.g. &gt;0.5), so we cannot tell it from the conditioned generation probability alone.	O	O	Reply	254
But, since some usual field is missing, the attention score as we defined tends to be low, and it might be used to detect such hallucination cases.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	254
However, the attention score is also low for function words and template elements.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
Thus, we further incorporate an unconditioned generation probability (base-LM) to detect those cases.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This motivation is made clearer in our revised paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]From a higher point of view, we do not claim that our definition of the confidence and attention scores are optimal; we proposed one way to implement the intuition.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
We have demonstrated several pieces of evidence that this implementation works: Figure 2 qualitatively demonstrates that the scores match human intuition; experiments regarding thresholding and ablation, etc.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
We believe they are all firm justifications for our model design.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding design details, we have tried several other variations of the attention score, the base-LM input-feeding, and the confidence score.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
The current implementation is selected based on PARENT F1 and manually investigating the learned scores.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]&gt; what it means for p(y | z, x) to be assumed to 1[line_break_token][line_break_token]Intuitively, we are assuming an oracle that can always recover the original target sequence y from its subsequence z; this is reasonable during training because we always know the gold reference for each training example.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	254
Technically, we note that p(y | z, x) is part of the model rather than the data.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	254
So this is just a modeling assumption that simplifies the formula.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	254
We assume p(y | z, x) to be a probability distribution over all possible target sequences, such that the probability is 1 for the gold reference and 0 otherwise.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	254
Yes, this distribution is the same for all z, as long as z is a subsequence taken from y. We don‚Äôt see any issue here.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]&gt; how Equation (12) is modeled: do the z's really only rely on the other sampled z's?	O	O	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Yes.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]&gt; Doesn't that require a different model than the one that calculates P^{\kappa}?	O	O	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]No, we don‚Äôt need a different model.	B-Reply	B-6	Reply	254
We are treating z as if z is the gold reference, and train our model to target this confident subsequence.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	254
This way, the generation model actually learns to skip unconfident tokens. (	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	254
Reviewer #1 raised concerns about this setting that it might cause disfluent generations; the fact that it does not is also a surprise for us.	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	254
Please see the discussions there.)	I-Reply	I-6	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]&gt; have you confirmed empirically that when it isn't zero the perplexity improves over the baseline model?	O	O	Reply	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This is an interesting question.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	254
First, we note an issue with perplexity on the WikiBio dataset: there are noisy tokens in the data whose log-likelihood converge to -inf.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	254
In our implementation, we set the smallest log-likelihood to log(2^{-100})=-69.3.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	254
Then, we compare the Pointer-Generator baseline with our No-variational model because the variational loss introduces random sampling into the training process.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	254
We report the log-perplexity as follows:[line_break_token][line_break_token]No-variational, kappa learned: 31.19 (Train)  39.24 (Valid)[line_break_token]No-variational, kappa=0:   31.21 (Train) 39.08 (Valid)[line_break_token]Pointer-Generator:   32.41 (Train) 40.14 (Valid)[line_break_token][line_break_token]So, compared to kappa=0, using learned kappa indeed improves training perplexity, but the validation perplexity gets worse.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	254
On the other hand, calibration improves the perplexity over the Pointer-Generator baseline, on both training and validation sets.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	254

This paper presents a method for conditional text generation that has higher factual precision, minimizing hallucination of facts.	O	O	Review	254
The method involves predicting confidence of generation at each time step and using this confidence measure to skip tokens during generation and calibrate output probabilities in test time.	O	O	Review	254
Their method achieves SoTA performance on automatically measured precision and human evaluated "faithfulness."	O	O	Review	254
However their method does see a drop in recall (automatic metric and human evaluation).	O	O	Review	254
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Comments and issues,[line_break_token]- The intuitive explanation for the confidence score is a little confusing.	B-Review	B-1	Review	254
In Section 4, page 3, you say that "If a token is likely a content word (i.e. when its generation probability by the encoder-decoder is much higher than the unconditioned language model), but the attention score is low, then the token might not be predicted based on the source, and could be hallucination."	I-Review	I-1	Review	254
However, this doesn't seem like an airtight conclusion.	I-Review	I-1	Review	254
Isn't it possible that the base-LM and enc-dec model have similar probabilities for a content word with the enc-dec attention being low?	I-Review	I-1	Review	254
This seems possible given your observation that low attention to the source is what may be causing content hallucination.	I-Review	I-1	Review	254
This same thing is essentially restated in section 4.1 "we expect P(y_t |y_&lt;t, x) to be higher than P(y_t | y_&lt;t) for content words so the confidence score will largely depend on the attention score", which seems more tangled up since P(y_t |y_&lt;t, x) inherently depends on the attention score.	O	O	Review	254
This is all clarified when you explain the alteration made to the base-LM.	B-Review	B-1	Review	254
I would recommend rewording/rearranging some of the earlier explanation for the efficacy of the confidence score since it seems that the alteration to the base-LM is an essential part of the explanation.	I-Review	I-1	Review	254

This paper aims to solve the unfaithful generation problem for a specific data-to-text generation task, i.e. wikibio dataset.	O	O	Review	254
The wikibio dataset has a specific feature, where the output doesn't often reflect the input info box.	O	O	Review	254
This will cause the traditional seq2seq-style neural generation models to hallucinate frequently since the training objective is often based on word likelihood.	O	O	Review	254

In training, it helps avoid learn to generate the low confidence words.	O	O	Review	254

ÄúProblem Setting‚Äù of the updated paper version:[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚ÄúSuppose there exists a signal X ~ p_X we wish to acquire, but we only have access to this signal through lossy, inaccurate observation Y ~ p_Y. The measurement process is modeled through a stochastic operator F mapping signals X to their associated observations Y. We will refer to F as the measurement process, which corrupts the input signal.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	166
F is parameterized by a random variable \Theta ~ p_\Theta following an underlying distribution p_\Theta we can sample from, which represents the factors of corruption.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	166
Thus, given a specific signal x, we can simulate its measurement by first sampling \theta from p_\Theta, and then computing F(x; \theta).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	166

Gaussian noise \Eps ~ \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I), so that the overall acquisition process becomes: [line_break_token]Different instances of F will be considered, e.g. like random occlusions, information acquisition from a sparse subset of the signal, overly smoothing out and corrupting the original distribution with additive noise, etc... In such cases, the factors of corruption \Theta might respectively represent the position of the occlusion, the coordinates of the acquired information, or simply the values of the additive noise.

This is a very interesting paper that achieves something that seems initially impossible: [line_break_token]to learn to reconstruct clear images from only seeing noisy or blurry images.	O	O	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper builds on the closely related prior work AmbientGAN which shows that it is possible to learn the *distribution* of uncorrupted samples using only corrupted samples, again a very surprising finding.	O	O	Review	166
[line_break_token]However, AmbientGAN does not try to reconstruct a single image, only to to learn the clear image distribution.	O	O	Review	166
The key idea that makes this is possible is knowledge of the statistics of the corruption process: the generator tries to create images that *after they have been corrupted* they look indistinguishable from real corrupted images.	O	O	Review	166
This surprisingly works and provably recovers the true distribution under a very wide set of corruption distributions, but tells us nothing about reconstructing an actual image from measurements.	O	O	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Given access to a generative model for clear images, an image can be reconstructed from measurements by maximizing the likelihood term.	O	O	Review	166
This method (CS-GAN) was introduced by Bora et al in 2017.	O	O	Review	166
Therefore one approach to solve the problem that this paper tackles is to first use AmbientGAN to get a generative model for clear images and then use CS-GAN using the learned GAN.	O	O	Review	166

Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Indeed, this is correct.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	166
The conditional AmbientGan baseline combines the approaches of AmbientGan and CS-GAN.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
First, a generative model G of the data is learned without having access to samples of the signal distribution using the AmbientGAN framework.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
Then, in order to reconstruct the signal from a corrupted measurement y, we look for an input vector z of G that produces a simulated measurement G(z) that looks like y, by minimizing the Euclidean distance between G(z) and y. This method suffers from several drawbacks, which we believe can explain the poor results:[line_break_token][line_break_token]* First drawback: suboptimality of the Generator.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
In theory, if the generator was optimal, under suitable conditions for the measurement process F, it would generate outputs belonging to the manifold of uncorrupted images (that we shall name M).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
Thus, projecting a measurement onto M should recover an uncorrupted image.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
However, this is never the case: in practice, GANs suffer from a number of problems.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
This means that it is possible that images from the manifold of generated images do not correspond to true samples: applying gradient descent to minimize the aforementioned distances, tend to generate  images similar to the corrupted images y, and not to uncorrupted images x. Our model does not suffer from this problem because it maximizes the log-likelihood and the prior term jointly.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
If G generates a signal that does not belong to M in order to maximize the log-likelihood term (similarly to what happens with the ConditionalAmbientGan baseline), the discriminator will easily be able to detect this and consequently, the reconstruction network G is corrected in order to avoid this behaviour.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* Second drawback : Euclidean distance used in ConditionalAmbientGan is not adapted in the general case considered in the paper.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
The natural thing to do would be to find a reconstruction from M that maximizes the likelihood p(y|x).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
If the corruption in the measurement process corresponds to iid additive noise, it is possible to show that the problem reduces to minimizing the euclidean distance between x and y, like in ConditionalAmbientGan.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
However, this is not necessarily the case for other measurement processes.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
Indeed, in the general formulation, the likelihood is intractable;it requires marginalizing on the noise variables \theta, and for each SGD step we would need to approximate it, which would be very costly.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166
Our likelihood term in the cost functions better reflects the true likelihood.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	166

[line_break_token][line_break_token]For the measurement process Patch-Band, Remove-Pixel and Remove-Pixel-Channel, Deep Image Prior (DIP) has access to the corruption parameter \theta of the associated measurement (we have used the inpainting formulation of DIP).	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	166

+ Figures visually describing them in appendix ) [line_break_token][line_break_token]To answer your question regarding the structure of the measurement process: the measurement (or corruption) process described in equation (1) is assumed known.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	166
This means that, as in most of the problem formulations for signal recovery, the structure of the stochastic function F is known.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	166
For example, let us consider the additive Gaussian noise case.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	166
F(X, \Theta) = X + \Theta, where X is the signal random variable to be recovered, and \Theta is the noise random variable (also called corruption parameter) whose underlying distribution p_\Theta is Gaussian.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	166
This distribution  p_\Theta is assumed known, although for a specific measurement, we do not know the precise value \theta that contributed to its corruption.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	166
In other cases, typically when the measurement process induces a more structured corruption such as in our Patch Band corruption, that randomly places a band occluding the original image (introduced in Section 4.2), \Theta follows a uniform distribution taking its values from the space of pixel coordinates.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	166
To simulate this corruption process, one samples a \theta from the prior p_\Theta, and uses it to corrupt the signal x, resulting in measurement y = F(x, \theta).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	166
In this case, F places a band using \theta as the position of the top of the band.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	166
This is exactly the same formulation as the one used for AmbientGan: the associated corruptions parameter \Theta for ‚ÄúDropPatch‚Äù which is very similar to our ‚ÄúPatchBand‚Äù, corresponds to the position of the occluding patch (refer to the official implementation [1]).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	166

It is also a lot less complex than methods that can achieve reasonable retention performance (DGR, DGR + distillation and RtF) - these methods require training a generative model (a VAE) to produce pseudo-training examples, whereas our method does not require training an external model.

My main concern is that experiments are only performed in the two-task setting, which is highly restrictive.	B-Review	B-1	Review	166

There are various problems with considering only a two-task setting (see for example Farquhar and Gal, "Towards Robust Evaluations of Continual Learning").	I-Review	I-1	Review	166
It is too easy to optimise parameters and methods to work in the two-task setting that will not generalise to more than two tasks, which the authors seem to claim.	I-Review	I-1	Review	166

Aside from this, the experiments seem detailed, with a reasonable baseline, large-scale experiments (on ImageNet), and with an ablation study.	O	O	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]It seems to me like the anchors need to be chosen before training.	B-Review	B-2	Review	166

The benefit of this is that the sphere is a closed surface, unlike the original Euclidean space the vectors lie in.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	166
In Euclidean space, all points can easily be pushed very far away from each other, or brought very close together - neither of these scenarios help with classifying points correctly.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	166

The authors add a second term to the triplet loss that is essentially making the loss a combination of the triplet and siamese loss.	B-Review	B-1	Review	166
It‚Äôs not really explained anywhere why they do this and whether its essential to the performance.	I-Review	I-1	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Is there anything specific to continual learning done or is the paper essentially pointing out this existing method (metric learning + nearest neighbor) is surprisingly effective for forgetting.	B-Review	B-2	Review	166
If this is the case the authors should present it in this way I think.	I-Review	I-2	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Although triplet loss can often yield reasonably performance on classification problems it tends to not perform as well as cross entropy loss, this is observed in other works as well as this one.	B-Review	B-3	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A major question of mine: it is not clear from the method nor experiments what samples are stored after task A for the kNN classifier.	B-Review	B-4	Review	166

[line_break_token][line_break_token]MNIST experimental comparisons are currently suspect.	B-Review	B-5	Review	166
It is  very surprising that LwF does so poorly, do the authors have some explanation for this.	I-Review	I-5	Review	166
LwF is typically a reasonable baseline for these 2 task settings (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01920.pdf)."	O	O	Review	166

LwF and EWC simply not working to any degree seem to me like  rather dramatic claims to make without any explanation.	B-Review	B-5	Review	166
[line_break_token]Cryptically the fine-tuning baseline described in 4.2 is not shown here for MNIST?	I-Review	I-5	Review	166
This seems a major oversight[line_break_token][line_break_token]CIFAR10/Imagenet Experiments[line_break_token]It is not clear if the baseline finetuning is done on only the top weights or the entire network.	B-Review	B-6	Review	166
Both of these baselines should be considered.	I-Review	I-6	Review	166
Another good baseline to consider is finetuning with cosine distance and only the top weights as in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09458.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09458.pdf</a> and other recent works should also be considered[line_break_token][line_break_token]Why do the authors not include any of the baselines from MNIST experiments here, for example LwF.[line_break_token][line_break_token]Ablations study the need for normalization and dynamic margin, it seems these are helpful for accuracy and forward transfer (and not as critical for minimizing forgetting).	B-Review	B-7	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]The author state their method is agnostic to the task boundaries, its a bit unclear what this means in this context.	B-Review	B-9	Review	166
The procedure is not online and the labels of the samples are being used?	I-Review	I-9	Review	166
If the authors are referring to the need to add additional outputs to the ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù model this seems like it can be trivially addressed by simply saying outputs are added the first time a new class is seen thereby making it agnostic to the boundary in the same sense as this method.	I-Review	I-9	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Clarity [line_break_token]Can be problematic at times.	B-Review	B-11	Review	166

[line_break_token][line_break_token]-(minor) first/2nd paragraph of 3.1 seems a bit redundant making it hard to follow[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall I think the idea to consider metric learning and local adaptation for continual learning is interesting, however the current work is currently lacking in both experimental evidence (appropriate comparisons) and clear motivation/difference to existing work  for its particular instantiation of this idea.	B-Review	B-10	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]++++Post Rebuttal++++[line_break_token][line_break_token]Thank you for your detailed responses.	O	O	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The clarification about ‚Äútask-agnostic‚Äù for the experiments does make them look more relevant than I had previously assessed.	O	O	Review	166
I do want to note that the language used for this is inconsistent with the ones used in other papers, which typically calls this a ‚Äúshared-head‚Äù setting (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10112.pdf," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10112.pdf,</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09733.pdf," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09733.pdf,</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08671.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08671.pdf</a> ).	O	O	Review	166
It is also somewhat inconsistent with the authors own definition of ‚Äútask agnostic learning‚Äù given in the introduction of this paper which implies it is something related to task boundaries at training time, in fact this is something related to availability of the task id at test time.	B-Review	B-13	Review	166
I suggest the authors to make this more clear.	I-Review	I-13	Review	166
Furthermore, the authors should highlight all this in the experiment text, e.g. noting EWC does poorly but this is because we use a different protocol than this and this paper etc.	I-Review	I-13	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding the experiments under this light they do look more reasonable.	O	O	Review	166
Indeed it has been observed that EWC works poorly in the shared-head setting <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10112.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10112.pdf</a>[line_break_token]Regarding the new 5 task CIFAR-10 the results are interesting, however I will point the authors to the work above (Rwalk) which also reports results in this setting better than theirs (but not by too much).	B-Review	B-6	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I do however still have issues regarding the memory usage of the method, specifically which data needs to be stored from previous tasks.	B-Review	B-4	Review	166
It is still not completely clear and I find obfuscated since just one sentence not even fully answering the concern about this was added to the manuscript despite myself and another reviewer asking about it.	I-Review	I-4	Review	166
My understanding based on the (somewhat conflicted responses) of the authors is they store a substantial amount of prior task data, but most of this is only used  at test time.	I-Review	I-4	Review	166
For example for imagenet as much as 1000 images/class are stored for testing time.	I-Review	I-4	Review	166
This begs the question why not use this data for training as well if it is allowed to be used by the model at testing time (and therefore preserved from the first task), why is the storage cost of this data not considered and how do the authors justify this still being a lifelong learning setup.	I-Review	I-4	Review	166
As an alternative, why can't one use a much bigger fully parametric model that uses the same amount of storage as the authors model + stored images.	I-Review	I-4	Review	166
It seems it is not fair to compare these to methods that cant utilize this large storage amount.	I-Review	I-4	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Finally its not clear if this data is stored as raw images or somehow stored as embeddings.	I-Review	I-4	Review	166
If it is stored as embeddings this would require some discussion on how the authors avoid representation drift when the next task is training.	I-Review	I-4	Review	166
If the authors store raw images, it means at evaluation time the entire raw dataset needs to be re-encoded, therefore the model can‚Äôt perform easily anytime inference.	I-Review	I-4	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Unfortunately the discussion period ended but I would have liked more clarification on this, on the other hand these pieces of information should really have been in the manuscript in the first place.	O	O	Review	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, my impression of the paper is improved.	O	O	Review	166
 But I do think it could use some further writing revisions to emphasize/clarify key points: a) the method is not new (it says e.g. in abstract ‚Äúnew model‚Äù which is misleading) but its application in CL is under-explored b) the experiments show poor performance on existing methods because most of those are not designed nor work well for the shared head ‚Äútask agnostic‚Äù setting, while metric learning handles it gracefully.	B-Review	B-3	Review	166
 c) be explicit about what is the memory being stored when moving onto the next task (this should be somewhere visible and explicit) and how this is justified[line_break_token][line_break_token]	B-Review	B-4	Review	166

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The simplicity of our method is an important advantage compared to other methods that add specialized regularizers, because (1) a simpler method is more broadly applicable because it can be used in settings when the signals required by the regularizers (e.g.: task identity or boundary - more on this later) are unavailable, (2) and is more flexible because it can be combined with other approaches.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	166
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The insight that metric learning can be used effectively for continual learning is novel and did not appear in prior work to our knowledge - this represents a new perspective for continual learning research that catastrophic forgetting may be partly caused by limitations in the model itself rather than problems with the training objective.

This paper introduces smooth market games (SM-games), a class of smooth games characterized by pairwise zero sum interactions, and show SM-games possess a number of appealing properties:[line_break_token]- A fixed point is a local Nash equilibrium iff it is stable[line_break_token]- Local convergence to stable fixed points[line_break_token]- Unstable fixed points are repellent[line_break_token]- Dynamics are bounded, assuming diminishing returns-to-scale for sufficiently large vectors.

The paper studies the impact of using customized number representations on accuracy, speed, and energy consumption of neural network inference.	O	O	Review	497
Several standard computer vision architectures including VGG and GoogleNet are considered for the experiments, and it is concluded that floating point representations are preferred over fixed point representations, and floating point numbers with about 14 bits are sufficient for the considered architectures resulting in a small loss in accuracy.	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper provides a nice overview of floating and fixed point representations and focuses on an important aspect of deep learning that is not well studied.	O	O	Review	497
There are several aspects of the paper that could be improved, but overall, I am leaned toward weak accept assuming that the authors address the issues below.	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]1- The paper is not clear that it is only focusing on neural network inference.	B-Review	B-1	Review	497
Please include the word "inference" in the title / abstract to clarify this point and mention that the findings of the paper do not necessarily apply to neural network training as training dynamics could be different.	I-Review	I-1	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]2- The paper does not discuss the possibility of adopting quantization tricks during training, which may result in the use of fewer bits at inference.	B-Review	B-2	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]3- The paper is not clear whether in computing the running time and power consumption, it includes all of the modules or only multiply-accumulate units?	B-Review	B-3	Review	497
Also, how accurate are these numbers given different possible designs and the potential difference between simulation and production?	B-Review	B-7	Review	497
Please elaborate on the details of simulation in the paper.	I-Review	I-7	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]4- The whole discussion about "efficient customized precision search" seem unimportant to me.	B-Review	B-4	Review	497
When such important hardware considerations are concerned, even spending 20x simulation time is not that important.	I-Review	I-4	Review	497
The exhaustive search process could be easily parallelized and one may rather spend more time at simulation at the cost of finding the exact best configuration rather than an approximation.	I-Review	I-4	Review	497
That said, weak configurations could be easily filtered after evaluating just a few examples.	I-Review	I-4	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]5- Nvidia's Pascal GP100 GPU supports FP16.	B-Review	B-5	Review	497
This should be discussed in the paper and relevant Nvidia papers / documents should be cited.	I-Review	I-5	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]More comments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Parts of the paper discussing "efficient customized precision search" are not clear to me.	B-Review	B-6	Review	497

We thank you for your valuable time and comments.	O	O	Reply	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]===Performance and power methodology[line_break_token]We evaluate our results based on the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, the key building block of any hardware implementation of a DNN.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	497
The MAC operations capture the majority of the DNN performance and power breakdown [1]. Other units will scale with the customized-precision design as well, so we expect that a full-system implementation would show benefits very similar to our results.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	497
For example, using 84% [1] as the power used by compute, we find our reported 3.4x savings in energy would become 3.15x (time = 0.84/3.4 + 0.16/(32-bit/14-bit from linear scaling) = 0.31 => speedup = 1/0.31 = 3.15x).	O	O	Reply	497
Similarly, full-system performance is dictated by MAC performance.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]===ASIC design tool details[line_break_token]Our comparisons are made using designs synthesized with Synopsys Design Compiler and are further verified using Synopsys PrimeTime and SPICE simulations.	B-Reply	B-7	Reply	497
The specific cell library, provided by the manufacturer, which produces area, power, and timing information, cannot be disclosed.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	497
These cell libraries are used for timing verification for chip tape out, hence, they must (and do) accurately model real hardware.	I-Reply	I-7	Reply	497

This paper explores the performance-area-energy-model accuracy tradeoff encountered in designing custom number representations for deep learning inference.	O	O	Review	497
Common image-based benchmarks: VGG, Googlenet etc are used to demonstrate that fewer than1 6 bits in a custom floating point representation can lead to improvement in runtime performance and energy efficiency with only a small loss in model accuracy.	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Questions:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	497
Does the custom floating point number representation take into account support for de-normal numbers?	B-Review	B-1	Review	497
[line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	497
Is the custom floating point unit clocked at the same frequency as the baseline 32-bit floating point unit?	B-Review	B-2	Review	497
If not, what are the different frequencies used and how would this impact the overall system design in terms of feeding the data to the floating point units from the memory[line_break_token][line_break_token]Comments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	497
I would recommend using the IEEE half-precision floating point (1bit sign, 5bit exponent, and 10bit mantissa) as a baseline for comparison.	B-Review	B-4	Review	497
At this point, it is well known in both the ML and the HW communities that 32-bit floats are an overkill for DNN inference and major HW vendors already include support for IEEE half-precision floats.	I-Review	I-4	Review	497
[line_break_token]2.	O	O	Review	497
In my opinion, the claim that switching to custom floating point  lead to a YY.ZZ x savings in energy is misleading.	B-Review	B-5	Review	497
It might be true that the floating-point unit itself might consume less energy due to smaller bit-width of the operands, however a large fraction of the total energy is spent in data movement to/from the memories.	I-Review	I-5	Review	497
As a result, reducing the floating point unit‚Äôs energy consumption by a certain factor will not translate to the same reduction in the total energy.	I-Review	I-5	Review	497
A reader not familiar with such nuances (for example a typical member of the ML community), may be mislead by such claims.	I-Review	I-5	Review	497
[line_break_token]3.	O	O	Review	497
On a similar note as comment 2, the authors should explicitly mention that the claimed speedup is that of the floating point unit only, and it will not translate to the overall workload speedup.	B-Review	B-7	Review	497
Although the speedup of the compute unit is roughly quadratic in the bit-width, the bandwidth requirements scale linearly with bit-width.	I-Review	I-7	Review	497
As a result, it is possible that these custom floating point units may be starved on memory bandwidth, in which case the claims of speedup and energy savings need to be revisited.	I-Review	I-7	Review	497
[line_break_token]4.	O	O	Review	497
The authors should also comment on the complexities and overheads introduced in data accesses, designing the various system buses/ data paths when the number representation is not byte-aligned.	B-Review	B-6	Review	497
Moving to a custom 14-bit number representation (for example) can improve the performance and energy-efficiency of the floating point unit, but these gains can be partially eroded due to the additional overhead in supporting non-byte aligned memory accesses.	I-Review	I-6	Review	497

Aside from minor differences in empirical results that depend on denormal floating-point arithmetic support, we expect that our conclusions hold.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	497
A different design that operates on denormal floating-point representations will, ideally, allow one less bit in the floating-point exponent for the same accuracy, but will be disadvantaged by increased hardware area, circuit delay, and power.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]===Frequency scaling of customized-precision units[line_break_token]We scale the ALU frequency with the inverse of the hardware circuit delay, so each customized-precision design can have a different frequency.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]===Frequency of compute compared to storage[line_break_token]Our DRAM memory and compute clocks (frequencies) are different, which is common across almost all hardware designs (e.g., modern CPU/GPU designs).	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	497
DRAM memory fabrication is primarily optimized for higher transistor density (i.e. memory capacity) rather than higher frequency, which is opposite of computational units.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]===Validity of MAC results[line_break_token]The MAC operations capture the majority of the DNN performance and power breakdown [1]. Other units will scale with the customized-precision design as well, so we expect that a full-system implementation would show benefits very similar to our results.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	497

[line_break_token][line_break_token]===Compute throughput as DNN bottleneck[line_break_token]The DRAM memory bandwidth requirements for DNNs is much lower than its computational requirements [2]. This is due to matrix multiplication, the central DNN computational kernel, requiring roughly N^2 memory operations (i.e. from loop tiling [3]) compared to N^3 arithmetic operations.

The paper provides a first study of customized precision hardware for large convolutional networks, namely alexnet, vgg and googlenet.	O	O	Review	497

Only the activations of the last layer are evaluated, but on what data ?	I-Review	I-1	Review	497
On all the validation set ?	I-Review	I-1	Review	497
Why would this be faster than computing the classification accuracy ?	I-Review	I-1	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The results should be useful for hardware manufacturers, but with a catch.	B-Review	B-2	Review	497
All popular convolutional networks now use batch normalization, while none of the evaluated ones do.	I-Review	I-2	Review	497
It may well be that the conclusions of this study will be completely different on batch normalization networks, and fixed-point representations are best there, but that remains to be seen.	I-Review	I-2	Review	497
It seems like something worth exploring.	I-Review	I-2	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall there is not a great deal of novelty other than being a useful study on numerical precision trade-offs at neural network test time.	B-Review	B-3	Review	497
Training time is also something of interest.	I-Review	I-3	Review	497
There are a lot more researchers trying to train new networks fast than trying to evaluate old ones fast.	I-Review	I-3	Review	497

We thank you for your valuable time and comments.	O	O	Reply	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]===Search method clarifications[line_break_token]Our search model only requires a small subset (evaluation uses 10) of the validation inputs to predict accuracy by leveraging all of the activations in the last layer, rather than observing only the top-1 (or top-5) results.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	497
Last layer activations require fewer inputs compared to top-1 accuracy, since each DNN input produces many scalar activations rather than a single binary correctness value.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	497
For example, 10 inputs using top-1 accuracy provides 10 binary values (i.e. each DNN output being either correct or incorrect), while the activations for 10 ImageNet inputs provides 10,000 scalar values (i.e. 10 DNN inputs * 1000 scalar output activations per ImageNet input).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]===Batch normalization[line_break_token]Batch normalization primarily impacts the training process of DNNs rather than inference, so we expect to arrive at very similar conclusions with or without it.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	497
Batch normalization during inference applies a fixed linear transformation to each activation, which requires few hardware resources and does not change the shape of the activation distribution.	O	O	Reply	497

audio quality and computational constraints.	O	O	Review	497
Some experimental validation of certain architectural choices is also provided.	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My main concern with this work is that it reads more like a tech report: it describes the workings and design choices behind one particular system in great detail, but often these choices are simply stated as fact and not really motivated, or compared to alternatives.	B-Review	B-1	Review	497
This makes it difficult to tell which of these aspects are crucial to get good performance, and which are just arbitrary choices that happen to work okay.	I-Review	I-1	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]As this system was clearly developed with actual deployment in mind (and not purely as an academic pursuit), all of these choices must have been well-deliberated.	B-Review	B-2	Review	497
It is unfortunate that the paper doesn't demonstrate this.	I-Review	I-2	Review	497
I think this makes the work less interesting overall to an ICLR audience.	I-Review	I-2	Review	497
That said, it is perhaps useful to get some insight into what types of models are actually used in practice.	I-Review	I-2	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]An exception to this is the comparison of "converters", model components that convert the model's internal representation of speech into waveforms.	B-Review	B-3	Review	497
This comparison is particularly interesting because some of the results are remarkable, i.e. Griffin-Lim spectrogram inversion and the WORLD vocoder achieving very similar MOS scores in some cases (Table 2).	I-Review	I-3	Review	497
I wish there would be more of that kind of thing in the paper.	I-Review	I-3	Review	497
The comparison of attention mechanisms is also useful.	I-Review	I-3	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I'm on the fence as I think it is nice to get some insight into a practical pipeline which benefits from many current trends in deep learning research (autoregressive models, monotonic attention, ...), but I also feel that the paper is a bit meager when it comes to motivating all the architectural aspects.	B-Review	B-12	Review	497
I think the paper is well written so I've tentatively recommended acceptance.	I-Review	I-12	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]Other comments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The separation of the "decoder" and "converter" stage is not entirely clear to me.	B-Review	B-4	Review	497
It seems that the decoder is trained to predict spectrograms autoregressively, but its final layer is then discarded and its hidden representation is then used as input to the converter stage instead?	I-Review	I-4	Review	497
The motivation for doing this is unclear to me, surely it would be better to train everything end-to-end, including the converter?	I-Review	I-4	Review	497
This seems like an unnecessary detour, what's the reasoning behind this?	I-Review	I-4	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- At the bottom of page 2 it is said that "the whole model is trained end-to-end, excluding the vocoder", which I think is an unfortunate turn of phrase.	B-Review	B-5	Review	497
It's either end-to-end, or it isn't.	I-Review	I-5	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- In Section 3.3, the point of mixing of h_k and h_e is unclear to me.	B-Review	B-6	Review	497
Why is this done?	I-Review	I-6	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The gated linear unit in Figure 2a shows that speaker embedding information is only injected in the linear part.	B-Review	B-7	Review	497
Has this been experimentally validated to work better than simpler mechanisms such as adding conditioning-dependent biases/gains?	I-Review	I-7	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- When the decoder is trained to do autoregressive prediction of spectrograms, is it autoregressive only in time, or also in frequency?	B-Review	B-8	Review	497
I'm guessing it's the former, but this means there is an implicit independence assumption (the intensities in different frequency bins are conditionally independent, given all past timesteps).	I-Review	I-8	Review	497
Has this been taken into consideration?	I-Review	I-8	Review	497
Maybe it doesn't matter because the decoder is never used directly anyway, and this is only a "feature learning" stage of sorts?	I-Review	I-8	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- Why use the L1 loss on spectrograms?	B-Review	B-9	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The recent work on Parallel WaveNet may allow for speeding up WaveNet when used as a vocoder, this could be worth looking into seeing as inference speed is used as an argument to choose different vocoder strategies (with poorer audio quality as a result).	B-Review	B-10	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- The title heavily emphasizes that this model can do multi-speaker TTS with many (2000) speakers, but that seems to be only a minor aspect that is only discussed briefly in the paper.	B-Review	B-11	Review	497
And it is also something that preceding systems were already capable of (although maybe it hasn't been tested with a dataset of this size before).	I-Review	I-11	Review	497
It might make sense to rethink the title to emphasize some of the more relevant and novel aspects of this work.	I-Review	I-11	Review	497

In decoder architecture, the loss for mel-scale spectrogram generation guides training of the attention mechanism, because the parameters are trained with the gradients from&nbsp;mel-scale spectrogram generation besides vocoder parameter generation.	O	O	Reply	497
Our experiments suggest that a mel-scale spectrogram is a compact audio representation with sufficient information content to train a robust attention mechanism.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	497
Using mel-scale spectrograms yields fewer attention mistakes, compared to other high-dimensional audio representations (e.g., linear spectrogram, or other vocoder parameters).&nbsp;We observe that inputting the last hidden states of the decoder rather than mel-scale spectrograms to the converter network yields slightly higher audio quality.	O	O	Reply	497
We attribute this to the richer information content of the hidden states, as a&nbsp;mel-scale spectrogram is a fixed representation.	O	O	Reply	497

 If the authors provide improved insight, discussion of system specifics, and experiments, I'd be open to raising my review.	O	O	Review	497
 Below, I give some specific questions and suggestions that could be addressed in future drafts.	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- It might be worth giving a sentence or two defining the TTS problem - the paper is written assuming background knowledge about the problem setting, including different possible input sources, what a vocoder is, etc.	B-Review	B-2	Review	497
 The ICLR community at large may not have this domain-specific knowledge.	I-Review	I-2	Review	497
[line_break_token]- Why "softsign" and not tanh?	B-Review	B-3	Review	497
 Seems like an unusual choice.	I-Review	I-3	Review	497
[line_break_token]- What do the "c" and "2c" in Figure 2a denote?	B-Review	B-4	Review	497
[line_break_token]- Why scale (h_k + h_e) by \sqrt{0.5} when computing the attention value vectors?	B-Review	B-5	Review	497
[line_break_token]- "An L1 loss is computed using the output spectrograms" I assume you mean the predicted and target spectrograms are compared via an L1 loss.	B-Review	B-6	Review	497
 Why L1?	I-Review	I-6	Review	497
[line_break_token]- In Vaswani et al it was shown that a learned positional encoding worked about as well as the sinusoidal position encodings despite being potentially more flexible/less "hand-designed" for machine translation.	B-Review	B-7	Review	497
 Did you also try this for TTS?	I-Review	I-7	Review	497
 Any insight?	I-Review	I-7	Review	497
[line_break_token]- Some questions about monotonic attention: Did you use the training-time "soft" monotonic attention algorithm from Raffel et al during training and inference, or did you use the "hard" monotonic attention at inference time?	B-Review	B-8	Review	497
 IIUC the "soft" algorithm doesn't actually force strict monotonicity.	I-Review	I-8	Review	497
 You wrote "monotonic attention results in the model frequently mumbling words", can you provide evidence/examples of this?	I-Review	I-8	Review	497
 Why do you think this happens?	I-Review	I-8	Review	497
 The monotonic attention approach seems more principled than post-hoc limiting softmax attention to be monotonic, why do you think it didn't work as well?	I-Review	I-8	Review	497
[line_break_token]- I can't find an actual reference to what you mean by a "wavenet vocoder".	B-Review	B-9	Review	497
 The original wavenet paper describes an autoregressive model for waveform generation.	I-Review	I-9	Review	497
 In order to use it as a vocoder, you'd have to do conditioning in some way.	I-Review	I-9	Review	497
 How?	I-Review	I-9	Review	497
 What was the structure of the wavenet you used?	I-Review	I-9	Review	497
  Why?	I-Review	I-9	Review	497
 These details appear to be missing.	I-Review	I-9	Review	497
 All you write is the sentence (which seems to end without a period) "In the WaveNet vocoder, we use mel-scale spectrograms from the decoder to condition a Wavenet, which was trained separated".	I-Review	I-9	Review	497
[line_break_token]- Can you provide examples of the mispronunciations etc.	B-Review	B-10	Review	497
which were measured for Table 1?	I-Review	I-10	Review	497
 Was the evaluation of each attention mechanism done blindly?	I-Review	I-10	Review	497
[line_break_token]- The 2.07 MOS figure produced for tacotron seems extremely low, and seems to indicate that something went wrong or that insufficient care was taken to report this baseline.	B-Review	B-11	Review	497
 How did you adapt tacotron (which as I understand is a single-speaker model) to the multi-speaker setting?	I-Review	I-11	Review	497
[line_break_token]- Table 3 begs the question of whether Deep Voice 3 can outperform Deep Voice 2 when using a wavenet vocoder on VCTK (or improve upon the poor 2.09 MOS score reported).	B-Review	B-12	Review	497
 Why wasn't this experiment run?	I-Review	I-12	Review	497
[line_break_token]- The paragraph and appendix about deploying at scale is interesting and impressive, but seems a bit out of place - it probably makes more sense to include this information in a separate "systems" paper.	B-Review	B-13	Review	497
As another reviewer also raised a similar concern, we have paid significant attention to improve the explanations to motivate the model architecture choices in this paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example:&nbsp;[line_break_token]1) We have added a new section ("Convolution Blocks for Sequential Processing") to motivate the architecture design choices for the convolution blocks used in our model.&nbsp;[line_break_token]2) In the "Encoder" section, we have added the motivation behind mixing key vector h_k and embedding h_e.

In this paper, authors propose a set of  control experiments in order to get a better understanding of different deep learning heuristics: stochastic gradient with restart (SGDR),  warmup and distillation.	O	O	Review	497
Authors leverage the recently proposed mode connectivity (which fits a simple piecewise linear curve to obtain a low loss path that connect two points in parameter space) and CCA is a way to compute a meaningful correlation of the networks activations.	O	O	Review	497
All the experiments are done using a VGG-16 networks on CIFAR10.	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For SGDR, authors observe that the solutions found by SGDR or SGD does not appears to be in different basins.	O	O	Review	497
While this contradict previous claim, it goes in the same direction than recent works which  have similar observations for the small batch/large batch case [1]. Authors also identify that warmup tends to avoid large change the top-layers at the beginning of training and that you can achieve similar effect than warmup by freezing the top-layer.	O	O	Review	497
Finally authors show that most of the benefit of distillation happen by impacting the last deep layers of a network.	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token] [line_break_token]While I find all those findings valuable, it is not straightforward to see how they connect to a better understanding of training deep network and how significant they are.	B-Review	B-1	Review	497
In particular,  it is still unclear to me why heuristics such as SGDR is successful in practice or why freezing the top layer of a network improve trainability in a large batch setting?	I-Review	I-1	Review	497

Summary:[line_break_token]This paper uses the recently proposed techniques of mode connectivity and CCA to analyze two different popular heuristics in deep learning: [line_break_token](1) SGDR (stochastic gradient descent with restarts/cosine annealing of learning rate) [line_break_token](2) Learning rate warmup[line_break_token](3) Model distillation[line_break_token][line_break_token]For (1) they visualize 1d and 2d slices of the loss surface either using mode connectivity, or parameter points immediately before restarts to try and understand if the parameters sit in different local minima.	O	O	Review	497
For (2), they study the effect of learning rate warmup using CCA, coming to the conclusion that learning rate warmup helps stabilize the fully connected layers. (	O	O	Review	497
3) They also study model distillation with CCA, finding out that the higher layers are the most similar to the teacher model.	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Clarity: The paper is clearly written, cites lots of relevant work, and describes the experiments in detail.	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Originality: This paper seems original, while the techniques used are established, they conduct thorough experiments on phenomena in deep learning that haven't been studied.	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token] [line_break_token][line_break_token]Comments on Significance and Quality:[line_break_token]I liked parts (2), (3) of the paper most, as it seemed like conclusions from these parts were fairly clear: [line_break_token][line_break_token]Figures 4, 5 make the effect of warm restarts in the large batch setting on FC layers clear: the restarts help the layers stabilize better.	O	O	Review	497
I really liked the experiment in 4(d), where they tested this hypothesis by freezing the fully connected layers for the duration of the warmup.	O	O	Review	497
 It was interesting to see that this had no effect on the remainder of the trajectory.	O	O	Review	497
This seemed to be a good demonstration and investigation of the effect of warm restarts, and I appreciate the tests on different architectures in the supplementary material.	O	O	Review	497
I'd be curious to see if there's some way to further incorporate this into learning rate schedules.	B-Review	B-4	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I also liked Figure 6, exploring Model distillation, which showed that the higher layers of the shallower network were the most affected by the teacher network.	O	O	Review	497
The authors cite related work which suggests only training higher layers, and I'd be curious to see how only training higher layers affects accuracy.	B-Review	B-5	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]While I thought the experiments for part (1) SGD with Restarts were thorough, and appreciated Figure 1, which experimentally validated the use of mode connectivity, I felt there was some difficulty in interpreting the results.	B-Review	B-1	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Firstly, in Figure 2, the claim is that SGD with Restarts does possibly bridge local minima as the mode connectivity curves increase between the two convergence points.	B-Review	B-2	Review	497
However, we see in both 2(b) and 2(c) that the linear interpolation between both convergence points does *not* increase in loss.	I-Review	I-2	Review	497
In which case is there any reason to believe that the increase of MC in the middle means that SGDR is climbing a basin?	I-Review	I-2	Review	497
How do we know that the linear combination isn't closer to the path followed by SGDR?	I-Review	I-2	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For additional comparisons, it would be good to have the linear combination plots for Figure 1 also.	B-Review	B-1	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In general, it seems hard to make meaningful conclusions with low dimensional projections of a very high dimensional loss surface.	O	O	Review	497
We'd have to know some kind of theoretical property of MC to be able to do so.	B-Review	B-6	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Minor Comments[line_break_token][line_break_token]I think the figures in this paper could be much clearer.	B-Review	B-3	Review	497
In Figure 2 for example, the legend blocks some of the main areas of interest of the plot.	I-Review	I-3	Review	497
I would recommend cutting some of the raw learning rate figures and making all figures much bigger.	I-Review	I-3	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In figure 4(d), the text describes the process in training steps (200 training steps), but the plot is in epochs -- it would be better if the text and axis were consistent in units.	I-Review	I-3	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Conclusion:[line_break_token]Despite my concerns on the first part of this paper, I think the very thorough experiments, clear presentation and the interesting results on learning rate warmups and model distillation merit its acceptance.	O	O	Review	497

This paper empirically explores heuristics commonly used in deep learning: learning rate restarts, warmup and distillation.	O	O	Review	497
The authors utilize two recently proposed tools for neural network analysis: mode connectivity (MC) finding a low loss pathway between two given points in the space of DNN parameters and CCA measuring the correlation of  DNN layer activations.	O	O	Review	497

Authors mention Batch Normalization (BN) among heuristics widely used in deep learning.	I-Review	I-1	Review	497
It is known that properties of both loss surface and activations are different between DNN architectures which include BN layers and those which do not.	I-Review	I-1	Review	497
To emphasize generality of obtained results, it would be beneficial to conduct experiments for both types of DNN architectures as at the moment the majority of the results are presented for VGG architecture which typically does not include BN.	I-Review	I-1	Review	497
Impact of other architecture modifications (e.g. skip connections) might be considered as well.	I-Review	I-1	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- I find the significance of the results unclear.	B-Review	B-2	Review	497
Although the particular insights of the learning procedures are revealed there is not enough attention paid to their value for possible improvements of the procedures and their applications.	I-Review	I-2	Review	497
There is only one idea proposed by the authors based on the experimental results ‚Äì fixing the deeper layers during the warmup phase, but the practical implications of this idea are not discussed.	I-Review	I-2	Review	497

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Our responses to the two weaknesses pointed out in the review:[line_break_token][line_break_token](1) We agree that our observations can gain a lot more generality by covering variants that do and do not have Batch Normalization (BN).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	497

[line_break_token]This paper explores two related methods to reduce the number of parameters required (and hence the memory footprint) of neural NLP models that would otherwise use a large word embedding matrix.	O	O	Review	497
Their method, inspired by quantum entanglement, involves computing word embeddings on-the-fly (or by directly computing the output of the "word embedding" with the first linear layer of network).	O	O	Review	497
They demonstrate their method can save an impressive amount of memory and does not exhibit big performance losses on three nlp tasks that they explore.	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper is clearly written (with only a couple of typos) but does not yet reach publication standard.	O	O	Review	497
Whilst the empirical performance of their approach is promising from the perspective of saving reducing memory requirements, more experiments are required and more careful comparisons to baselines and other methods in the literature for saving memory/parameters.	B-Review	B-9	Review	497
In general the related work and experimental sections are weak and brief, with only superficial analysis.	I-Review	I-9	Review	497
There is  lack of careful analysis and insight into their results, as well as a careful comparisons to other work in this area.	I-Review	I-9	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The choice of tasks to evaluate on is broad, which is a strength, but is missing simpler tasks that one would expect to see, such as a text classification dataset, or simple bag-of-vectors style models.	B-Review	B-1	Review	497
In addition, the choice of models are somewhat outdated baselines.	B-Review	B-2	Review	497
It seems that transformers would be an ideal setting for their approach, as transformers have rather high dimensional word embedding matrices, but the authors do not run experiments with the now-ubiquitous Transformer.	I-Review	I-2	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The quantum inspiration is largely a distraction, and I think the paper would benefit from this element being scaled back or removed in order to free up space for more experiments.	B-Review	B-10	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors acknowledge one key weakness of their approach, that both training and inference time are increased (by 28% or 55% longer for DocQA depending on compression)  but much more work could be done to understand the best way to  mitigate for longer training and inference times.	B-Review	B-3	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors argue that reducing the memory footprint of models is vital to address hardware limitations for training and inference for large models like BERT or ROBERTA, but this argument is not particularly strong.	O	O	Review	497
Generally current limitations for training these kinds of models  are the long training times and being able to fit large batches onto our hardware, and the vocabulary matrix is only a constant factor here.	B-Review	B-4	Review	497
And since training time is a bottleneck, the added value of saving memory vs slowing the training speed by 30-50% is debatable.	I-Review	I-4	Review	497

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The obstacle to comparing published methods for word embedding compression empirically with outs is that existing methods have hard limits on the compression rate.	B-Reply	B-5	Reply	497

For the  DrQA / SQuAD experiments, we have |U|=118655, D=300, yet our method stores the embedding using just 380 floating numbers, a 380-fold reduction over the theoretical limit of PS-SGNS, with little impact on solution quality.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	497

[line_break_token]This paper proposes word2ket - a space-efficient form of storing word embeddings through tensor products.	O	O	Review	497
The idea is to factorize each d-dimensional vector into a tensor product of much smaller vectors (either with or without linear operators).	O	O	Review	497
While this results in a time cost for each word lookup, the space savings are enormous and can potentially impact several applications where the vocabulary size is too large to fit into processor memory (CPU or GPU).	O	O	Review	497
The experimental evaluation is done on several tasks like summarization, machine translation and question answering and convincingly demonstrates that one can achieve close to original model performance with very few parameters!	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This approach would be very useful due to growing model sizes in many areas of NLP (e.g. large pre-trained models) and more broadly, deep learning.	O	O	Review	497

The paper presents two methods to learn word embedding matrices that can be stored in much less space compared to traditional d x p embedding matrices, where d is the vocabulary size and p is the embedding size.	O	O	Review	497
Two methods are proposed: the first method estimates a p-dimensional embedding for a word as a sum of r tensor products of order n (tensor product of n q-dimensional embeddings).	O	O	Review	497
 This representation takes rnq parameters which can be much less than p, since p = q^n.	O	O	Review	497
The second method factorizes a full d x p embedding matrix jointly as a tensor product of much smaller t x q matrices and can obtain even larger space savings.	O	O	Review	497
Algorithms for efficiently computing full p-dimensional representations are also included.	O	O	Review	497
When only dot products are needed, the p-dimensional representations do not need to be explicitly constructed.	O	O	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In my opinion the terminology from quantum computing and entanglement is an unnecessary complication.	B-Review	B-1	Review	497
It would be better to simply talk about the special parametric form of the embeddings , which allows efficient storage.	I-Review	I-1	Review	497

B-Review	B-3	Review	497
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experimental results on summarization, machine translation, and QA show that the methods can obtain comparable results to models using traditional word embeddings while obtaining savings of up to one-thousand fold decrease in space needed for the embeddings.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The experimental results seem to conflate the issues of the dimensionality of the word embeddings versus that of the higher layers.	B-Review	B-5	Review	497
For example, in the summarization experiments, word2ketXS embeddings corresponding to 8000-dimensional embeddings are compared to a standard model with embeddings of size 256.	I-Review	I-5	Review	497
The LSTM and layers for the word2ketXS model would become quite large but their size is not taken into account.	I-Review	I-5	Review	497
In addition, the activation memory is often the major bottleneck and not the parameter memory.	I-Review	I-5	Review	497

This paper proposes a new method for estimating optimal transport plans and maps among continuous distributions, or discrete distributions with large support size.	O	O	Review	442
First, the paper proposes a dual algorithm to estimate Kantorovich plans, i.e. a coupling between two input distributions minimizing a given cost function, using dual functions parameterized as neural networks.	O	O	Review	442
Then an algorithm is given to convert a generic plan into a Monge map, a deterministic function from one domain to the other, following the barycenter of the plan.	O	O	Review	442
The algorithms are shown to be consistent, and demonstrated to be more efficient than an existing semi-dual algorithm.	O	O	Review	442
Initial applications to domain adaptation and generative modeling are also shown.	O	O	Review	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]These algorithms seem to be an improvement over the current state of the art for this problem setting, although more of a discussion of the relationship to the technique of Genevay et al would be useful: how does your approach compare to the full-dual, continuous case of that paper if you simply replace their ball of RKHS functions with your class of deep networks?	B-Review	B-1	Review	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The consistency properties are nice, though they don't provide much insight into the rate at which epsilon should be decreased with n or similar properties.	B-Review	B-2	Review	442
The proofs are clear, and seem correct on a superficial readthrough; I have not carefully verified them.	I-Review	I-2	Review	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The proofs are mainly limited in that they don't refer in any way to the class of approximating networks or the optimization algorithm, but rather only to the optimal solution.	B-Review	B-3	Review	442
Although of course proving things about the actual outcomes of optimizing a deep network is extremely difficult, it would be helpful to have some kind of understanding of how the class of networks in use affects the solutions.	I-Review	I-3	Review	442
In this way, your guarantees don't say much more than those of Arjovsky et al who must assume that their "critic function" reaches the global optimum: essentially you add a regularization term, and show that as the regularization decreases it still works, but under seemingly the same kind of assumptions as Arjovsky et al's approach which does not add an explicit regularization term at all.	I-Review	I-3	Review	442
Though it makes sense that your regularization might lead to a better estimator, you don't seem to have shown so either in theory or empirically.	I-Review	I-3	Review	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The performance comparison to the algorithm of Genevay et al is somewhat limited: it is only on one particular problem, with three different hyperparameter settings.	B-Review	B-4	Review	442
Also, since Genevay et al propose using SAG for their algorithm, it seems strange to use plain SGD; how would the results compare if you used SAG (or SAGA/etc) for both algorithms?	I-Review	I-4	Review	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In discussing the domain adaptation results, you mention that the L2 regularization "works very well in practice," but don't highlight that although it slightly outperforms entropy regularization in two of the problems, it does substantially worse in the other.	B-Review	B-5	Review	442
Do you have any guesses as to why this might be?	I-Review	I-5	Review	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]For generative modeling: you do have guarantees that, *if* your optimization and function parameterization can reach the global optimum, you will obtain the best map relative to the cost function.	B-Review	B-6	Review	442
But it seems that the extent of these guarantees are comparable to those of several other generative models, including WGANs, the Sinkhorn-based models of Genevay et al (2017, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00292/)," target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00292/),</a> or e.g. with a different loss function the MMD-based models of Li, Swersky, and Zemel (ICML 2015) / Dziugaite, Roy, and Ghahramani (UAI 2015).	O	O	Review	442
The different setting than the fundamental GAN-like setup of those models is intriguing, but specifying a cost function between the source and the target domains feels exceedingly unnatural compared to specifying a cost function just within one domain as in these other models.

Although the proposed method give better performance, it is not clear whether the better performance is due to the added complexity to the model (the attention mechanism) or truely resolving the under-fitting issue‚Äù[line_break_token][line_break_token]Our reasoning that the mean-aggregation acts as a bottleneck is as follows.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	442
In NPs, the aggregated representations r_C and s_C needs to have information about the particular function (the realisation of the stochastic process) not only at the context x-values but for all x-values in the domain for the predictions to generalise well to unseen targets.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	442
When we compute these aggregated representations simply by taking the mean of representations of each context pair, it will be difficult for the resulting representation to model the entire function, and may require a large representation dimensionality.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	442
On the other hand, cross-attention allows the aggregated representation r* to be specific to the target x-value x*, so that it suffices for the representation r* to only be informative about the prediction at x* instead of all x-values in the domain.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	442
We claim that this inductive bias allows the ANP to resolve the undefitting issue, not just because of the added model capacity (i.e. more parameters) that attention introduces.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	442
As evidence for this, on the left of Figure 3 we show quantitative results for differing sizes of the bottleneck in NPs, ranging from d=128 to 1024.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	442
The figure shows that raising d (i.e. increasing model capacity) does help achieve better reconstructions, but there seems to be a limit in how much the reconstructions can improve, hence showing that naively adding capacity to the model is insufficient in addressing the underfitting behaviour.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	442
We show that multihead (and dot-product) attention with d=128 gives a much faster decrease in the reconstructions than NPs with any value of d, both against iteration and wall-clock time.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	442
We would also like to point out that the number of parameters in the NP model for bottleneck size d is approximately 10d^2 (ignoring smaller order terms), whereas for multihead it is 15d^2 (so cross-attention introduces 5d^2 extra parameters).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	442
So the number of parameters of NP with d=1024 is much higher than that of multihead with d=128, yet we can get noticeably better performance with multihead attention.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	442
Hence the improvement in performance is mostly due to the attention mechanism rather than the increase in model complexity (i.e. number of parameters).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	442

It is clear that the Multihead ANP is much closer to the ground truth than the NP with very accurate predictive mean, despite there being evidence of underestimating the variance away from the contexts - one possible explanation for this is that variational inference usually leads to underestimates of predictive variance.

I would like to see an ablation study with the two separate techniques (self- and cross-attention processes) on NPs since the two techniques aim to improve different aspects of NPs.	B-Review	B-2	Review	442

This paper considers an architecture change to the transformer in which they swap the feedforward subcomponent of the standard transformer with an "attention only" variant that includes persistent "memory" vectors.	O	O	Review	442
The model is evaluated against a suite of baselines on the tasks of character- and word-level language modeling.	O	O	Review	442
Combining this "all attention" approach with adaptive span yields results about equivalent to the SOTA, in some cases with fewer parameters than existing models.	O	O	Review	442
The authors do a nice job of presenting ablation results.	O	O	Review	442
A key finding here, for example, is that the a model stripped of both persistent vectors and the feedforward sublayer performs poorly.	O	O	Review	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Overall, I'm on the fence regarding this submission.	O	O	Review	442
This is solid work, and the idea of exploiting persistent representations in the transformer seems promising.	O	O	Review	442
But the architecture change here is relatively minor, and the gains seem somewhat minor (the exception may be in Table 2 which shows equivalent performance with half the parameters to previous SOTA, but then no other model is in the range of O(100m) parameters, so hard to know what's going on here).	B-Review	B-1	Review	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]One thing I would have liked is more motivation.	B-Review	B-2	Review	442
If equivalence with fewer parameters is the main aim, then the model seems to fair reasonably well but the results are not really compelling.	I-Review	I-2	Review	442
If, on the other hand, the authors are primarily interested in exploiting persistence, then I think this could have been investigated a bit more exhaustively, and perhaps the focus need not be on necessarily replacing the feedforward subcomponent (although that is one reasonable strategy).	I-Review	I-2	Review	442
I do not see a huge inherent advantage to removing the feedforward layer, and it seems like there are alternative strategies --- at least equally as good --- to reduce parameters.	I-Review	I-2	Review	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A question for the authors: did you consider a vanilla Transformer with persistent memory vectors added?	B-Review	B-3	Review	442
This would be something like adding a constant dummy input (independent of the example) that would be passed forward and arbitrarily transformed.	I-Review	I-3	Review	442
I guess the meta-point here is that it doesn't seem to me that the persistent representations and the feedforward sublayer are necessarily mutually exclusive.	I-Review	I-3	Review	442

This paper proposes a simple modification to the ubiquitous Transformer model.	O	O	Review	442
Noticing that the feed-forward layer of a Transformer layer looks a bit like an attention over "persistent" memory vectors, the authors propose to explicitly incorporate this notion directly into the self-attention layer.	O	O	Review	442

[line_break_token][line_break_token]The model is tested on widedly-utilized character/word-level language modeling benchmarks, where it is found to outperform, or be on par with, existing models while using fewer number of parameters.	O	O	Review	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Insofar as architectural advancements can translate to general improvements across multiple NLP tasks, this paper could be seen as important.	O	O	Review	442
However, I am not sure that in 2019, demonstrating arguably-marginal perplexity improvements on standard datasets is enough.	B-Review	B-1	Review	442
I would love to see if this type of layer can result in better conditional generation models (e.g. translation, summarization), or can train GPT2/BERT/XLNet-style models whose representations better transfer to other tasks.	I-Review	I-1	Review	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I had some further questions/comments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- I found the motivation of the persistent memory vector as replacing the FF-layer somewhat tenuous.	B-Review	B-2	Review	442
Eq(5) is definitely different from Eq(9)!	I-Review	I-2	Review	442
In my opinion this work can be better motivated/presented as just a standalone modification to the Transformer layer.	I-Review	I-2	Review	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- While it is impressive that the proposed approach performs better (or on par with, in the case of character-level language modeling) than the previous state-of-the-art models which are larger, to me it is not immediately clear if the benefit is coming from the proposed modifications, or something else (e.g. some of the things mentioned in 4.3).	B-Review	B-3	Review	442
I understand most of this is taking from prior work, but as we all know, in deep models various architectural/hyperparameter modifications can interact in unexpected ways.	I-Review	I-3	Review	442

Therefore, as suggested, we added a comparable baseline Transformer trained with our code using exactly the same setting as our model in the appendix B.

A transformer layer actually consists of two sublayers, so its depth could be viewed as 2.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	442
In that case we added a baseline with 44 sublayers in the appendix B as mentioned above.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	442
If the depth is the number of transformer layers, then a same-depth baseline would have 36 layers, or 72 sublayers.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	442
This means it has twice as many nonlinear layers as our model.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	442
Training a such deep transformer model is known to be very unstable.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	442
We did try to train it, but the training diverged after 157k updates as shown in the appendix B. We tried to make it more stable by reducing the gradient clipping without success.	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	442
[line_break_token][line_break_token]- ‚ÄúWhat if you combine this with the FF sublayer as well?‚Äù[line_break_token]- Combining FF sublayer is an interesting idea that might improve the performance, but as mentioned above, the point of the paper was to simplify the architecture using a single attention mechanism, rather than pushing the limits of the SOTA.

This paper proposes an instance-wise feature selection method, which chooses relevant features for each individual sample.	O	O	Review	171
The basic idea is to minimize the KL divergence between the distribution p(Y|X) and p(Y|X^{(s)}).	O	O	Review	171
The authors consider the classification problem and construct three frameworks: 1) a selector network to calculate the selection probability of each feature; 2) a baseline network for classification on all features; 3) a predictor network for classification on selected features.	O	O	Review	171
The goal is to minimize the difference between the baseline loss and predictor loss.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The motivation of the paper is clear and the presentation is easy to follow.	O	O	Review	171
However, I have some questions on the model and experiments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1.	O	O	Review	171
How is Eq. (	B-Review	B-1	Review	171
5) formulated?	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
As the selector network does not impact the baseline network, an intuition regarding Eq. (	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
5) is to maximize the predictor loss, which seems not reasonable.	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
It seems more appropriate to use an absolute value of the difference in Eq. (	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
5).	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
Some explanation for the formulation of Eq. (	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
5) would be helpful.	I-Review	I-1	Review	171

The model introduces an extra hyper-parameter,, to adjust the sparsity of selected features.	B-Review	B-2	Review	171
I was curious how sensitive is the performance w.r.t.	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
this hyper-parameter.	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
How is determined in the experiments?	I-Review	I-2	Review	171

After the selector network is constructed, how are the features selected on testing data?	B-Review	B-3	Review	171
Is the selection conducted by sampling from the Bernoulli distribution as in training or by directly cutting off the features with lower probabilities?	I-Review	I-3	Review	171

Thank you for the insightful comments.	O	O	Reply	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A1: Equation (5) is the difference between the cross-entropies of the predictor and baseline networks.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	171
The first term (-sum_y log f_i^\phi (x^(s), s)) is the cross-entropy of the predictor network and the second term (-sum y log f_i^\gamma (x)) is the cross-entropy of the baseline network.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	171
The loss in equation (5) is defined as the ‚Äúfirst term ‚Äì second term‚Äù.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	171
The selector network is trained to minimize this, not maximize it.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	171
Note that the baseline network is introduced to reduce the variance of this quantity, and not as a term that the selector network can change (this is a standard technique used in the actor-critic literature).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Also note that if the baseline network term (the second term) in equation (5) is removed, then we simply end up with the predictor loss defined in the ‚ÄúPredictor Network‚Äù section (l_1).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]If instead we were to use absolute value, then when the baseline network loss is larger than the predictor network loss, the method would actually be trying to maximise the predictor network loss (which we do not want).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]It is important to note that we are not trying to minimize the difference between the predictor and baseline losses - we are using the baseline to reduce the variance of the overall loss and we are simply trying to minimize the predictor loss.

This paper proposes a new instance-wise feature selection method, INVASE.	O	O	Review	171
It is closely related to the prior work L2X (Learning to Explain).	O	O	Review	171
There are three differences compared to L2X. The most important difference is about how to backpropagate through subset sampling to select features.	O	O	Review	171
 L2X use the Gumbel-softmax trick and this paper uses actor-critic models.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper is written well.	O	O	Review	171
It is easy to follow the paper.	O	O	Review	171
The contribution of this paper is that it provides a new way,  compared to L2X, to backpropagate through subset sampling in order to select features.	O	O	Review	171
The authors compare INVASE with L2X and several other approaches on synthetic data and show outperforming results.	O	O	Review	171
In the real-world experiments, the authors do not compare INVASE with other approaches.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Regarding experiments, instance-wise feature selection is often applied on computer vision or natural language process applications, where global feature selection is not enough.	O	O	Review	171
This paper lacks experiments on CV or NLP applications.	O	O	Review	171
For the MAGGIC dataset, I expect to see subgroup patterns.	B-Review	B-5	Review	171
The patterns that authors show in Figure 2 are very different for all randomly selected 20 patients.	I-Review	I-5	Review	171
The authors do not explain why it is preferred to see very different feature patterns for all patients instead of subgroup patterns.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I have questions about other two differences from L2X, pointed by the authors.	O	O	Review	171
First, the selector function outputs a probability for selecting each feature \hat{S}^\theta(x).	B-Review	B-1	Review	171
In the paper of L2X, it also produces a weight vector w_\theta(x) as described in section 3.4.	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
I think the \hat{S}^\theta(x) has similar meaning as w_\theta(x) in L2X. In the synthetic data experiment, the authors fix the number of selected features for L2X so that it forces to overselect or underselect features in the example of Syn4.	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
Did the author try to relax this constraint for L2X and use w_\theta(x) in L2X to select features as using \hat{S}^\theta(x) in INVASE?	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Second, I agree with the authors that L2X is inspired by maximizing mutual information between Y and X_S and INVASE is inspired by minimizing KL divergence between Y|X and Y|X_S. Both intuitions lead to similar objective functions that INVASE has an extra term \log p(y|x) and \lambda ||S(x)||. INVASE is able to add a l_0 penalty on S(x) since it uses the actor-critic models.	B-Review	B-2	Review	171
For the \log p(y|x) term, as the author mentioned, it helps to reduce the variance in actor-critic models.	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
This \log p(y|x) term is a constant in the optimization of S(x).	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
In Algorithm 1, 12, the updates of \gamma does not depend on other parameters related to the predictor network and selector network.	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
Could the authors first train a baseline network and use it as a fixed function in Algorithm 1?	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
I don't understand the meaning of updates for \gamma iteratively with other parameters since it does not depend on the learning of other parameters.	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
Does this constant term \log p(y|x) have other benefits besides reducing variance in actor-critic models?	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I have another minor question about scaling.	B-Review	B-3	Review	171
How does the scaling of X affect the feature importance learned by INVASE?	I-Review	I-3	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Note: I have another concern about the experiments.	B-Review	B-4	Review	171
Previous instance-wise variable selection methods are often tested on CV or NLP applications, could the authors present those experiments as previous works?	I-Review	I-4	Review	171
Thank you for the insightful comments.	O	O	Reply	171

We are not suggesting that the patterns shown are preferred (or expected) but rather showing that when we use INVASE to discover features for MAGGIC, we find that the patterns are different (though, if you look at, for example, patients 9, 10 and 11 we see a similar pattern for all 3).

To us, this simply reinforces the fact that instance-wise feature selection is necessary - if MAGGIC did indeed only contain subgroup patterns then we would expect INVASE to pick these out (as it does in the synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments where, for example in Syn4, Syn5 and Syn6, there are two distinct subgroups)	I-Reply	I-5	Reply	171

In the proposed algorithm, we prepare three DNNs, which are predictor network, baseline network, and selector network.	O	O	Review	171
The predictor network and the baseline networks are trained so that it fits the data well, where the predictor network uses only selected features sampled from the selector network.	O	O	Review	171
The selector network is trained to minimize the KL-divergence between the predictor network and the baseline network.	O	O	Review	171
In this way, one can train the selector network that select different feature sets for each of given instances.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I think the idea is quite simple: the use of three DNNs and the proposed loss functions seem to be reasonable.	O	O	Review	171

[line_break_token][line_break_token]I have a concern on the scheduling of training.	B-Review	B-1	Review	171
Too fast training of the predictor network can lead to the subotpimal selection network.	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
I have checked the implementations in github, and found that all the networks used Adam with the same learning rates.	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
Is there any issue of training instability?	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
And, if so, how we can confirm that good selector network has trained?	I-Review	I-1	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]My another concern is on the implementations in github.	B-Review	B-2	Review	171
The repository originally had INVASE.py.	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
In the middle of the reviewing period, I found that INVASE+.py has added.	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
I am not sure which implementations is used for this manuscript.	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
It seems that INVASE.py contains only two networks, while INVASE+.py contains three networks.	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
I therefore think the latter is the implementation used for this manuscript.	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
If this is the case, what INVASE.py is for?	I-Review	I-2	Review	171
[line_break_token]I am also not sure if it is appropriate to "communicate" through external repositories during the reviewing period.	I-Review	I-2	Review	171

[line_break_token][line_break_token]A1: It is not true that fast training of the predictor network can lead to a suboptimal selector network.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	171
Even when the predictor network is fully trained after each selector network update, the selector network can converge optimally.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	171
However, because the input distribution of the predictor network changes with each update of the selector network, the predictor network will have to update after each selector update.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	171
It is therefore not possible for the predictor network to converge until after the selector network has converged.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	171
Therefore, there are no stability issues caused by using the same learning rates for each network.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A2: INVASE+.py is the code corresponding to the implementation found in this paper.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	171
INVASE.py corresponds to the same implementation but without the baseline (i.e. just the selector and predictor networks).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	171
In practice we found both to perform similarly, but the derivation of INVASE+ is a little more natural, and as such we used it for the paper.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]We have since changed the names in the repository to INVASE and INVASE- (so that now INVASE is indeed the implemented method and INVASE- is the method without the baseline).	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	171

Summary:[line_break_token]The authors present a PyTorch based framework for performing second-order[line_break_token]reverse mode autodiff for meta-learning.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]First, the authors present a formalization of a general prototypical[line_break_token]meta-learning setting.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token]They then provide an algorithm that solves this problem via gradient based[line_break_token]optimization.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token]Finally, perhaps the main contribution is a specific PyTorch implementation[line_break_token]of said algorithm.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The type of meta-learning setting the authors consider is one where a gradient[line_break_token]based inner loop optimizer finds by performing a finite number of steps.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token]The inner loop optimizer is parameterized through that consists of[line_break_token]two parts and.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token]The parameters are somehow part of the loss used for[line_break_token]training in the inner loop.	O	O	Review	171
Example: Regularization paramter.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token]The parameters do not occur in the loss but in the[line_break_token]optimizer step.	O	O	Review	171
Example: Learning rate.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Example of an inner loop step:[line_break_token]where are the parameters of a neural network, is the training loss, is the regularizer, is the learning rate, is the regularization parameter.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token]In this example we would have.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authos assume, the output of the inner loop after steps to[line_break_token]be differentiable wrt.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token]Furthermore, the meta-learning loss is assumed to be differentiable wrt[line_break_token]so that a gradient of the meta-learning loss wrt to can be computed.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token]The authors also assume the meta-learning loss to be sufficient smooth in[line_break_token]such that a gradient based optimization can even be used for meta learning to[line_break_token]a local optimum.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors explicitly write down the reverse mode auto differentiation of[line_break_token]the inner loop and show how to, in that way, compute the gradient of the[line_break_token]meta-learning loss wrt to.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The reverse (adjoint) mode auto differentiation of the above example inner loop step[line_break_token]is the following step (iterated over in reverse down from to:[line_break_token]where accumulates the gradient of wrt and accumulates the gradient of wrt.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors give some implementation details specific to some frameworks necessary[line_break_token]for implementing such "gradient of an inner loop".	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The authors present experiments where they show how to meta-learn learning rates[line_break_token]with their framework.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token]They also how their framework can be used to quickly implement a MAML type[line_break_token]meta-learning optimizer ablation study comparing various combinations of[line_break_token]architecture, optimizer and inner loop steps etc..[line_break_token][line_break_token]Recommendation:[line_break_token]I propose to reject the paper.	O	O	Review	171
[line_break_token]In my eyes the only contribution is the implementation of a meta-learner in[line_break_token]PyTorch based on well known methods.	B-Review	B-11	Review	171
[line_break_token]The provided unifying formalization is theoretically inaccurate (see below)[line_break_token]and to me come across as merely a motivation for their framework[line_break_token](but no value added compared to existing literature).	I-Review	I-11	Review	171

[line_break_token][tab_token]I would recommend not to use the operator here, since for[line_break_token][tab_token]something like a neural network would for example either return a global[line_break_token][tab_token]optimum (which no optimizer used in practice finds, and is not ment here)[line_break_token][tab_token]or would take on a set value with multiple local minima for example.

The key findings do not appear to be novel (neurons can have state that is modified by history of the neuron's experience), and are assumptions of their model (based on known experimental results), so it is unclear that they are significant new contributions (given the paucity of details about their specific approach, it is difficult to judge).

[line_break_token][line_break_token]I would like to add some key comments in defense of our work:[line_break_token][line_break_token]- I will highlight the key contributions of our work and stress on the fact that our presentation well-suits the ICLR venue: [line_break_token][line_break_token]-[tab_token]We provided a clear-compact overview on the mechanisms of the non-associative learning within the nervous system of the C. elegans.

Within the first part of the paper, we built up several insights towards understanding the mechanism of learning by provided key notes on the structure and dynamics of the nervous system during the learning process.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-[tab_token]We have constructed a detailed mathematical simulation platform for our analyses and tried to draw a general overview on the principles we found by using our simulator, in such a compact report.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
However, as the reviewer is fully aware, explaining the details of a neuronal model and synaptic connectivity models is extremely difficult in such a compact version.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
We therefore, structured our work to be understandable for a larger audience who are not much familiar with the field.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
We also planned to include the details of the equations and analyses, within the poster-session at the ICLR workshop in order to establish a clear picture on our novel work, interactively.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]-[tab_token]The first Key finding states the novel fact that an additional layer of input neurons can be placed in a network and their properties and state can depend on the structure of the input features and data.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
The second key finding states that synapses can have states and that can significantly changes the behavior of the entire network.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151

[line_break_token][line_break_token]I would like to add some comments:[line_break_token][line_break_token]-[tab_token]Reviewer is fully aware of the fact that explaining the details of the equations used for synaptic connectivity and neural dynamics, requires way more that 3 single-column pages.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]We have mentioned within the text of the abstract where we can modify in the neuron model in order to create the effect of gene modifications in a sensory neuron habituation.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
examples include:[line_break_token][line_break_token]1)[tab_token]Conductance of K-Channel decreases over time, due to the gene functions described in [1]. We then proposed to have the following expression for the maximum conductance of the potassium channel, G_K:[line_break_token][line_break_token]G_K, is set to a dynamic variable expressed as follows:[line_break_token]G_K = 10 exp(-0.02*t) +3, [line_break_token]where parameters are determined empirically.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]We also hypothesised that the calcium pump plays a key-role in the suppression of the calcium level in the sensory neuron.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
For the Calcium pump, its maximum conductance has been set to a dynamic variable in a sigmoid-like function: [line_break_token]G_pump = 10 / (exp(-0.01(t+200)) + 1)[line_break_token][line_break_token]Furthermore, We hypothesised that an inactivation-calcium gate should play a role in the learning mechanism.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
[line_break_token]Therefore, we design an inactivation gate, h, as follows: [line_break_token][line_break_token]dh/dt = (h_inf ‚Äì h) / tau_h,[line_break_token]where h_inf = 1 / 1 + H * exp((v-v_half)/k_h),[line_break_token]where the h_inf is the steady state value of the inactivation gate, with gate rate parameters H, v_half and k_h.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]I have a more fundamental question about the task.	B-Review	B-1	Review	151
How much does the model learn to identify parts of the problematic source code?	I-Review	I-1	Review	151
How much does the model learn to identify signs unrelated to the source code, such as things in the header?	I-Review	I-1	Review	151
I assume that in many cases you can judge whether a piece of binary is malware just by looking at the cosmetics of the program, but these features might not generalize well in the long run.	I-Review	I-1	Review	151
I assume it would be much more useful to identify certain sequence of instructions and memory addresses based on cpu architectures.	I-Review	I-1	Review	151
It would be great to analyze the CNN to see what it is paying attention to.	I-Review	I-1	Review	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The other fundamental question about the task is obfuscation.	B-Review	B-2	Review	151
On the one hand, in theory there is no universal tool to overcome obfuscation (with the standard crypto assumptions).	I-Review	I-2	Review	151
On the other hand, it's probably easy to detect trivial obfuscation, because the resulting program binaries would look significantly different from regular program binaries.	I-Review	I-2	Review	151
How often are binaries obfuscated in general?	I-Review	I-2	Review	151
How do these affect the model's performance?	I-Review	I-2	Review	151
What are the characteristics of regular program binaries?	I-Review	I-2	Review	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Programs as data are more stringent than natural images and words.	B-Review	B-3	Review	151
The CNNs might require a lot of effort just learning the common idioms of programming, such as control flows, loops, from the binaries.	I-Review	I-3	Review	151
I think the CNNs might benefit from these high-level constructs/templates when identifying malwares.	I-Review	I-3	Review	151
Since CNNs or deep models in general are strong at coping with noise, it might be useful to look at how they behave on mutated malware.	I-Review	I-3	Review	151

In this aspect the automatic convolutional features might be very similar to the traditional hand-engineered features which cover mainly the "envelope" of the executable[line_break_token][line_break_token]2) We do think that obfuscation can be overcome in theory, emulation/sandboxing being one (relatively) universal tool.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	151
However we do not expect the convnet to do the job.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	151
Because of the type "explanations" we have observed so far, we think that the performance may not be hurt significantly by including obfuscated files (indeed we use fairly simple/imperfect detection of obfuscation and our dataset certainly contains a large portion of obfuscated files already).

Tests on the whole collection will be hopefully ready soon.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	151

Uncertainty of stochastic inference usually helps filling the space by considering larger areas of codes than deterministic process.	I-Review	I-5	Review	151
Also, since at each step, the next code is conditionned by the whole past sequence of codes, besides the increasing complexity induced, I am wondering if such a model is able to efficiently encode the dynamics and the stochasticity of the video.	I-Review	I-5	Review	151
In fact, a given z_t does not encode any dynamics nor uncertainty at that point, only the image (it cannot since it is fully determined via the invertible function from the image).	I-Review	I-5	Review	151
Imagine that at a given point, two very different scenarios can follow, with very different following frames.	I-Review	I-5	Review	151
In that case, how could the next state could encode these two different futures with a simple gaussian in the space ?	I-Review	I-5	Review	151
Also,  it would be useful to compare the model with a version where the invertible frame encoder and the sequential model would be learned separately, to better understand what the model really does during training.	B-Review	B-3	Review	151
A study of the impact of the hierarchy depth would also be useful.	B-Review	B-4	Review	151
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]Also, an additional real-world dataset would be useful for really assessing the performance of the model, since BAIR is known to be fully random and the past does not highly impact the future.	B-Review	B-2	Review	151
A possible dataset would be KTH.	I-Review	I-2	Review	151
Other baselines could also be considered, notably the famous approach from  [Denton et al 2017]. [line_break_token][line_break_token]At last, the clarity of some parts could be improved.	B-Review	B-1	Review	151

[line_break_token]2.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	151
We added Section 4.1, where we briefly explain the multi-scale architecture before moving on to the autoregressive latent dynamics model.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	151
We describe the invertible transformations used in the multi-scale architecture and how the per-frame latent variables per level (scale) are inferred.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
[line_break_token]3.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	151
We added the second last paragraph under Section 4.2 that describes how the invertible multi-scale architecture and the autoregressive latent dynamics model contribute to different parts of the training objective.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q: Additional baseline and dataset[line_break_token][line_break_token]As requested, we added results from SVG-LP [Denton &amp; Fergus 2018], another strong baseline to Figure 4 and Figure 3.	O	O	Reply	151
VideoFlow either outperforms or is comparable to SVG-LP on all metrics in the paper.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	151
We also added results from CDNA [Finn et al 2016], a strong deterministic baseline to our results in Figure 4.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In regard to our choice of the BAIR dataset for comparisons, it is a standard evaluation benchmark used in the stochastic video prediction literature.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	151
We believe the BAIR robot dataset is challenging due to its stochasticity i.e. there are multiple possible futures for the robot arm in the absence of supervision via actions as well as unknown physical properties of the objects.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	151
We agree that including experiments on larger and high resolution datasets would indeed be even more interesting to explore in future[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q: Learning the invertible encoder and sequential model separately[line_break_token][line_break_token]We did attempt training the invertible encoder and sequential model separately in our initial experiments.

[line_break_token]But the total compute time of 2 (2a + 2b), was similar to (1).	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
In addition this training scheme added increased complexity to our model, so we disbanded this after our initial efforts.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Q: Impact of hierarchy depth[line_break_token][line_break_token]With a flow level of 1, our generated samples were able to capture the global structure of the robotic arm (for eg, a red blob).	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	151
 This is similar to Fig 9 in [Kingma &amp; Dhariwal, 2018], where a flow model with a lower number of levels of hierarchy captures global structure.	O	O	Reply	151
We also show qualitatively in [1] and Section 5.3, that the latents at lower levels encode background objects as smaller scales while higher levels encode larger objects, such as the robotic arm.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	151

This paper presents a stochastic model based on Glow for conditional video generation.	O	O	Review	151
The major novelty of this work is to introduce the flow-based models to video modeling and learn the video dynamics via the dependencies of the latent variables.	O	O	Review	151
The general idea is reasonable and the proposed model is technically correct, but I have the following concerns mainly about the originality and the experiments.	O	O	Review	151
 [line_break_token][line_break_token]**Above all, most of the text in Section 3 is very similar (or exactly the same) to the text of the Glow paper (the background section).**	O	O	Review	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚Äî Significance and originality ‚Äî[line_break_token]a.1) In Section 1, the authors discussed some possible application scenarios of video prediction models, e.g. learning from unlabeled data and being used for downstream tasks.	B-Review	B-4	Review	151
However, all models mentioned here, including [Mathieu et al 2016] and [Finn et al 2016], are deterministic models.	I-Review	I-4	Review	151
Thus, in what way can the stochastic model proposed in this paper be used in real applications?	I-Review	I-4	Review	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]a.2) VideoFlow can be viewed as an extension of the Glow model.	B-Review	B-5	Review	151
There are two problems.	I-Review	I-5	Review	151
First, the originality is limited.	I-Review	I-5	Review	151
I don‚Äôt think modeling the temporal dependencies of the latent variables with a convolutional network is a significant contribution to the conditional flow-based methods.	I-Review	I-5	Review	151
Second, this paper is not self-contained.	I-Review	I-5	Review	151
After reading Section 4.2, I have to check the previous literature to find the objective function, the network details, or the training procedure.	I-Review	I-5	Review	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚Äî Experiments ‚Äî[line_break_token]b.1) Throughout the experiments, the VideoFlow model is mainly compared with two stochastic video prediction models that were probably proposed by the same research group.	B-Review	B-1	Review	151
If it is possible, the authors might include other stochastic models such as the SVG-LP [Denton &amp; Fergus 2018], and at least one deterministic model such as the E3D-LSTM [Wang et al 2019] as well.	O	O	Review	151
[line_break_token][Wang et al 2019] E3D-LSTM: A Model for Video Prediction and Beyond.	B-Review	B-1	Review	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]b.2) The evaluation metric bits-per-pixel was not directly optimized by the previous video generation/prediction models.	B-Review	B-2	Review	151
Thus, the comparisons in Table 2 might be unfair.	I-Review	I-2	Review	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]b.3) Since training the Glow model requires a huge computational cost, how is the training efficiency of the VideoFlow model compared with other stochastic video generation models?	B-Review	B-3	Review	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]‚Äî Other ‚Äî[line_break_token]c.1) In Section 4, it is not clear what the temporal border effect means?	B-Review	B-6	Review	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]AFTER REBUTTAL:[line_break_token]Though the overall novelty is still not fully convincing, this paper may shed some insights into video generation by introducing flow-based models to this topic.	B-Review	B-7	Review	151
I have increased my score from 3 to 6.	O	O	Review	151

[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experiments[line_break_token]-----------------[line_break_token]b1) SVG-LP: As requested, we added results from SVG-LP [Denton &amp; Fergus 2018], another strong baseline to Figure 4 and Figure 3 in our revision.	O	O	Reply	151
VideoFlow either outperforms or is competent with SVG-LP on all the metrics used in the paper.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Deterministic baseline: We evaluated two deterministic baselines CDNA [Finn et al, 2016] and EPVA [Wichers et al, 2017] on the BAIR Robot pushing dataset.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
The samples from the CDNA model were qualitatively better as compared to the samples from the EPVA model.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
So, we added results from [Finn et al, 2016] on multiple metrics to Figure 4 of our revision.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]b2) We believe we made a good-faith effort; We estimated the best-possible beta for the video-VAE‚Äôs post training.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	151
 We also employed importance sampling using 100 samples from the posterior which gives a much tighter bound on the bits-per-pixel.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	151
Our goal was to measure how the VAE models perform out-of-the-box on a density estimation task.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	151
 In other words, in addition to being better / competent with the VAE approaches, our model also has the additional advantage of good likelihood numbers.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]b3) Our VideoFlow model reported in the paper has 45M parameters as compared to SVG-LP that has around 23M parameters.	B-Reply	B-3	Reply	151
But, we performed the following experiments to make a convincing case.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]* We trained a smaller version of our model (VideoFlow small) with 12M parameters.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
We report our results in Section I of the appendix (VideoFlow: low parameter regime) in the revision.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
We are slightly better than SVG-LP on VGG perceptual metrics despite being 2x smaller.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
 We lose ~0.2 bpp as compared to VideoFlow large but our samples are still largely coherent. [	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
2,3][line_break_token][line_break_token]* For VideoFlow small and VideoFlow large, we reported our results after 5 days and 2 weeks (600K steps) on 8 GPU‚Äôs respectively.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
But we gain very little (around 0.04-0.05 bpp) between training our model for 200K and 600K steps.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
 We attached our bits-per-pixel on the validation set as a function of training steps over here which validates this claim [1]. We were able to generate high quality samples within 150-200K steps.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
We expect our results should be comparable or slightly worse if at all, when evaluated on a checkpoint at 200K steps.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
In comparison, the video-VAE models were trained between 2-3 days on 1 GPU.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In future, we could leverage improvements in normalizing flows to further close this gap.	I-Reply	I-3	Reply	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Significance[line_break_token]----------------[line_break_token]a.1) Good examples are [Hafner et al 2018] and [Kaiser at al 2018] where they report higher scores in numerous planning and reinforcement learning tasks by utilizing stochastic video prediction models.	B-Reply	B-4	Reply	151
Also, [Nair et al 2018], leverage a stochastic video prediction model for self-supervision.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	151
[line_break_token][line_break_token]In short, a deterministic model cannot accurately model settings where there are multiple possible outcomes, (most real-life settings) and is obliged to predict a statistic of all the possible outcomes.	I-Reply	I-4	Reply	151

The paper presents an approach to learning shared neural representations of temporal abstractions in hierarchical RL, based on actor-critic methods.	O	O	Review	397
The approach is illustrated in two tasks: gridworld with objects and a simplified Minecraft problem).	O	O	Review	397
 The idea of providing symbolic descriptions of tasks and learning corresponding "implementations" is potentially interesting and the empirical results are promising.	O	O	Review	397
 However, there are two main drawbacks of the current incarnation of this work.	B-Review	B-1	Review	397
 First, the ideas presented in the paper have all been explored in other work (symbolic specifications, actor-critic, shared representations).	I-Review	I-1	Review	397
 While related work is discussed, it is not really clear what is new here, and what is the main contribution of this work besides providing a new implementation of existing ideas in the context of deep learning.	I-Review	I-1	Review	397
The main contribution if the work needs to be clearly spelled out.	O	O	Review	397
 Secondly, the approach presented relies crucially on curriculum learning (this is quite clear from the experiments).	B-Review	B-2	Review	397
 While the authors argue that specifying tasks in simplified language is easy, designing a curriculum may in fact be pretty complicated, depending on the task at hand.	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
 The examples provided are fairly small, and there is no hint of how curriculum can be designed for larger problems.	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
Because the approach is sensitive to the curriculum, this limits the potential utility of the work.	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
It is also unclear if there is a way to provide supervision automatically, instead of doing it based on prior domain knowledge.	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
[line_break_token]More minor comments:[line_break_token]- The experiments are not described in enough detail in the paper.	B-Review	B-3	Review	397
It's great to provide github code, but one needs to explain in the paper why certain choices were made in the task setup (were these optimized?	I-Review	I-3	Review	397
What's this the first thing that worked?)	I-Review	I-3	Review	397
Even with the code, the experiments as described are not reproducible[line_break_token]- The description of the approach is pretty tangled with the specific algorithmic choices.	B-Review	B-4	Review	397
Can the authors step back and think more generally of how this approach can be formalized?	I-Review	I-4	Review	397
 I think this would help relate it to the prior work more clearly as well.	I-Review	I-4	Review	397
NOVELTY[line_break_token][line_break_token]As described in the related work section, our approach indeed shares a number of similarities in existing work on learning hierarchical policy representations.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	397
Structurally the model is quite similar to the Option--Critic approach of Bacon & Precup; this is not intended to be a contribution of the paper.	O	O	Reply	397
What we claim to be novel are (1) the training condition (using discrete high-level policy representations without an explicit grounding or feature abstraction hierarchy) and (2) the objective (using the small amount of extra structure in the training data to decouple actors from critics across multiple tasks).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	397
You mention that symbolic specifications have been explored in other work---as discussed in our earlier comment, we've done our best to describe the differences with nearest neighbors, but are not aware of any previous approaches that learn with as little high-level supervision as we use here.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
Again, if you can let us know exactly what you have in mind we would greatly appreciate it!	O	O	Reply	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]CURRICULA[line_break_token][line_break_token]The general curriculum learning approach (Algorithm 2) can construct a sampling distribution for any collection of tasks: it relies only on the sketch length and the current empirical performance of the model, both of which can be computed without any task-specific engineering.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	397
The collections of tasks in this paper were in fact designed to give rise to particularly challenging curricula (no length-1 tasks, various subpolicies that appear only as constituents of very long tasks, etc.)	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	397
and demonstrate robustness to decisions about task selection and curriculum design.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]TASKS[line_break_token][line_break_token]We did most of our development on a restricted subset (only length-2 and length-3 sketches) of crafting domain tasks.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	397
Generalization to longer crafting tasks, as well as generalization to the maze domain, worked out of the box without any modifications to the initial task design or tuning of hyperparameters.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	397
As some evidence that the task design process is indeed reproducible, we are happy to point to follow-up work by Rob Fergus's group, who have already succeeded in reimplementing our tasks and evaluation for a different model architecture (<a href="https://uclmr.github.io/nampi/talk_slides/rob-nampi.pdf)."

This paper studies the problem of abstract hierarchical multiagent RL with policy sketches, high level descriptions of abstract actions.	O	O	Review	397
The work is related to much previous work in hierarchical RL, and adds some new elements by using neural implementations of prior work on hierarchical learning and skill representations.	O	O	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Sketches are sequences of high level symbolic labels drawn from some fixed vocabulary, which initially are devoid of any meaning.	O	O	Review	397
Eventually the sketches get mapped into real policies and enable policy transfer and temporal abstraction.	O	O	Review	397
Learning occurs through a variant of the standard actor critic architecture.	O	O	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Experiments are provided through a standard game like domain (maze, minecraft etc.).	O	O	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper as written suffers from two problems.	O	O	Review	397
One, the idea of policy sketches is nice, but not sufficiently fleshed out to have any real impact.	B-Review	B-1	Review	397
It would have been useful to see this spelled out in the context of abstract SMDP models to see what they bring to the table.	I-Review	I-1	Review	397
What one gets here is some specialized invocation of this idea in the context of the specific approach proposed here.	I-Review	I-1	Review	397
Second, the experiments are not thorough enough in terms of comparing with all the related work.	B-Review	B-2	Review	397
For example, Ghavamzadeh et al explored the use of MAXQ like abstractions in the context of mulitagent RL.	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
It would be great to get a more detailed comparison to MAXQ based multiagent RL approaches, where the value function is explicitly decomposed.	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
We have done our best to discuss relationships and provide comparisons with existing work on hierarchical policy learning, and would be happy to do so in more detail if told exactly what in the extremely large family of techniques for policy abstraction we should compare to.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	397
We remain somewhat puzzled by references to multiagent RL	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	397

The paper proposes a new RL architecture that aims at learning policies from sketches i.e sequence of high-level operations to execute for solving a particular task.	O	O	Review	397
The model relies on a hierarchical structure where the sub-policy is chosen depending on the current operation to execute in the sketch .	O	O	Review	397
The learning algorithm is based on an extension of the actor-critic model for that particular case, and also involves curriculum learning techniques when the task to solve is hard.	O	O	Review	397
Experimental results are provided on different learning problems and compared to baseline methods.	O	O	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper is well-written and very easy to follow.	O	O	Review	397
I am not really convinced by the impact of such a paper since the problem solved here can be seen as an option-learning problem with a richer supervision (i.e the sequence of option is given).	B-Review	B-1	Review	397
It thus corresponds to an easier problem with a limited impact.	I-Review	I-1	Review	397
Moreover, I do not really understand to which concrete application this setting corresponds.	B-Review	B-2	Review	397
For example, learning from natural langage instructions is clearly more relevant.	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
So since the model proposed in this article is not a major contribution and shares many common ideas with existing hierarchical reinforcement learning methods,  the paper lacks a strong motivation and/or concrete application.	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
So, the paper only has a marginal interest for the RL community[line_break_token][line_break_token]@pros: [line_break_token]* Original problem with well design experiments[line_break_token]* Simple adaptation of the actor-critic method to the problem of learning sub policies[line_break_token][line_break_token][line_break_token]@cons:[line_break_token]* Very simple task that can be seen as a simplification of more complex problems like options discovery, hierarchical RL or learning from instructions[line_break_token]* No strong underlying applications that could help to 'reinforce' the interest of the approach[line_break_token]	B-Review	B-1	Review	397
[line_break_token]TRAINING CONDITION[line_break_token][line_break_token]We could have done a better job of making this clearer: The reviewer is correct that there is not a natural source of sketch-like training annotations (as there is for e.g. natural language instructions).	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	397
Our claim is that these sketches are nonetheless extremely easy to produce, contain very few bits of information, but nevertheless result in dramatic improvements in training performance.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
The extra annotation we use here literally fits in a 10-line text file.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
We thus think it is reasonable for system designers to take a few minutes to write such a file, and then use a training objective that can efficiently exploit the information contained in it.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]NATURAL LANGUAGE[line_break_token][line_break_token]We also want to emphasize that the learning problem considered here is very different from the one normally encountered in natural language processing.	B-Reply	B-2	Reply	397
There, the learned model is a policy that conditions on both environment states and text to determine next actions; this policy is completely useless in the absence of instructions.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	397
By contrast, our approach induces a collection of options that can later be employed in sketch- or language-free hierarchical RL sections (as shown in the final experiment in our paper), making the approach much more general.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	397
We are not aware of any work that uses natural instructions to induce policy fragments that can be executed even when those instructions are not present.	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	397
We believe the current work is the first step in that direction	I-Reply	I-2	Reply	397

The paper introduces a novel way of learning Hamiltonian dynamics with a generative network.	O	O	Review	397
The Hamiltonian generative network (HGN) learns the dynamics directly from data by embedding observations in a latent space, which is then transformed into a phase space describing the system's initial (abstract) position and momentum.	O	O	Review	397
Using a second network, the Hamiltonian network, the position and momentum are reduced to a scalar, interpreted as the Hamiltonian of the system, which can then be used to do rollouts in the phase space using techniques known from, e.g., Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling.	O	O	Review	397
Finally, a decoder network can use the system's phase space location at any rollout step to generate images of the system.	O	O	Review	397
The HGN can further be modified, leading to a flow-based model, the Neural Hamiltonian Flow (NHF).	O	O	Review	397
[line_break_token]The authors evaluate the HGN on four simulated physical systems, showing substantial improvements over the competing Hamiltonian Neural Network (HNN).	O	O	Review	397
Lastly, the NHF is shown to be able to model complex densities, which can further be interpreted in terms of the kinetic and potential energy.	O	O	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]This paper is a rare treasure.	O	O	Review	397
It tackles a well-motivated problem and introduces a, to my knowledge, completely new framework for embedding Hamiltonian dynamics in a generative model.	O	O	Review	397
This is hugely inspiring!	O	O	Review	397
The paper is a joy to read and includes very informative figures providing a high-level understanding of the proposed models.	O	O	Review	397
Accept is a no-brainer.	O	O	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]That being said, I have a few questions and suggestions for improvements.	O	O	Review	397
My biggest complaint is the evaluation of the NHF model.	B-Review	B-1	Review	397
I would have liked to see a comparison to a state-of-the-art flow-based model in terms of density modelling.	I-Review	I-1	Review	397
The authors state that the NHF offers more expressiveness and computational benefits over standard flow-based models, but this is never shown.	I-Review	I-1	Review	397

Summary: The authors present a method for learning Hamiltonian functions that govern a dynamical directly from observational data.	O	O	Review	397
 The basic approach uses three networks: 1) an inference network (I'm not clear why this is not just called an encoder), that maps past observations to a latent p,q space in a VAE-like fashion; 2) a Hamiltonian network that governs the time-evolution of the system over this latent state; and 3) a decoder network that outputs the observation from the latent state.	O	O	Review	397
 In addition to introducing this basic formalism, the [line_break_token][line_break_token]Comments: I have mixed opinions on this paper, though am leaning slightly toward acceptance.	O	O	Review	397
 The overall notion of learning a Hamiltonian network directly is a great one, though really this is due to the Hamiltonian Neural Networks paper of Greydanus et al 2019.	B-Review	B-1	Review	397
 Although the focus in that work is on applying learned Hamiltonian networks directly to physics-based data, they also have an encoder-decoder network just using a classical autoencoder instead of a VAE.	I-Review	I-1	Review	397
 So my first impression is that the benefits of the proposed HGN over HNNs in Figure 6 is really just an artific of this replacement.	I-Review	I-1	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Perhaps because the authors also felt this was a marginal contribution, the paper's ultimate value may prove to be in the consideration of such networks for the purposes of normalizing flow models.	B-Review	B-2	Review	397
 This portion seemed a little bit underdeveloped in the paper, to be honest, but overall the idea of parameterizing a normalizing flow with a Hamiltonian dynamical system seems like a good one (e.g., allowing for easier large-timestep inference).	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
 But on the flipside, it does seem like the presentation here is rather brief, i.e., just defining the ELBO without much context or detail, etc.	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Thus, while I'm very much on the fence on this paper, I think the marginal improvement over HNNs via a better encoder/decoder model, plus the realization that these methods are a good fit for normalizing flow models, altogether put the paper slightly above bar for me.	O	O	Review	397
ear Reviewer, thank you for your thoughtful comments and feedback.	O	O	Reply	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]You are right that our work is closely related to the Hamiltonian Neural Network (HNN) model by Greydanus et al, 2019.	B-Reply	B-1	Reply	397
We would like to note that our work was done concurrently to the work by Greydanus and colleagues.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
We would also like to clarify the differences between our Hamiltonian Generative Network (HGN) and HNN.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
We apologize if this was not made clear in the original manuscript.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The most obvious difference is that HGN is a generative model and uses the VAE framework rather than a deterministic autoencoder to infer the phase space from pixels.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
However, this difference does not account for our improved results, as even the deterministic version of our model greatly outperforms the HNN (see Table 1 in the original manuscript).	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
The key difference between the two methods is that our proposed HGN learns the Hamiltonian function directly, rather than learning its derivatives.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
This is a very important distinction.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
Because the HNN model learns the derivatives of the Hamiltonian, it requires access to the time derivatives dH/dp and dH/dq of the system, which means that the model is trained in an essentially supervised manner.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
When there is no access to the true derivatives of the Hamiltonian for supervision, one has to resort to finite differences, which can be quite inaccurate.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
On the other hand, our HGN model learns the energy function directly from data and does not require such supervision.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
HNN also requires a priori knowledge of the dimensionality of the phase space and a separable Hamiltonian, while our model requires no a priori knowledge and does not depend on a separability assumption.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
Finally, given that our model is generative, it can be sampled to generate novel rollouts, which HNN cannot.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397
Taking all of these factors together, our model is able to model all of the visual datasets considered in our paper well, while HNN struggles to learn anything beyond an average pixel reconstruction (see see Tbl.	I-Reply	I-1	Reply	397

The paper proposes two ideas: 1) Hamiltonian Generative Networks (HGN) and 2) Neural Hamiltonian Flow (NHF).	O	O	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Hamiltonian Generative Networks are generative models of high-dimensional timeseries which use hamiltonian differential equations to evolve latent variables (~position and ~momentum vectors) through time (using any differentiable integration scheme).	O	O	Review	397
Given the ~position vector a decoder network generate predictions.	O	O	Review	397
The initial latent variables are inferred using a VAE style inference network that takes a sequence of images as the input.	O	O	Review	397
The decoder, inference network and crucially the hamiltonian energy function is learned by minimizing a VAE style ELBO on observed sequences.	O	O	Review	397
The model induces a strong hamiltonian physics prior and is quite elegant all in all.	O	O	Review	397
The model is evaluated on 4 simulated physics tasks, and beats the only baseline the Hamiltonian Neural Network (HNN).	O	O	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Neural Hamiltonian Flow notes that hamiltonian dynamics are invertible and volume preserving, which is the properties you need for neural flow models.	O	O	Review	397
As such it propose to use a series of hamiltonian update steps with multiple learned energy functions as a flexible density estimator.	O	O	Review	397
The resulting density estimator is subjectively evaluated on three 2d toy density estimation tasks.	O	O	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I propose a weak accept as I think the paper is interesting and well written, but could be much better.	O	O	Review	397
The paper explains how both HGN and NHF work, but not much more.	O	O	Review	397
The HGN is only compared to a single other method (the closely related HNN), on four toy benchmarks.	B-Review	B-1	Review	397
The NHF is barely evaluated, and not compared to anything.	I-Review	I-1	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Does the authors actually care about modelling physics and think their method is superior at this?	B-Review	B-2	Review	397
If so, they should compare and contrast to some of the many, many papers on modelling physics, e.g. [1,2,3,4] and references herein.	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
If not, what do they care about?	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
Where do they think this model can be useful?	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
Why should anyone use this model over some of the many, many other models one could use?	I-Review	I-2	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]Similarly for the NHF, if I only read this paper I have no idea whether it's better than any of the other flow based models.	B-Review	B-3	Review	397
Is it faster (to sample?	I-Review	I-3	Review	397
to eval likelihood?)	I-Review	I-3	Review	397
is it a better estimator?	I-Review	I-3	Review	397
Why should I use it?	I-Review	I-3	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]I think the paper would benefit from being split into two papers, each thoroughly examining one idea.	B-Review	B-4	Review	397
[line_break_token][line_break_token]A few questions and minor comments[line_break_token][line_break_token] - While the hamiltonian dynamics expect position and momentum vectors, the neural network is free to use those however it sees fit.	B-Review	B-5	Review	397
Actually, if I understand correctly, the position vector must also encode the color of the objects for the 2 and 3 body problem.	I-Review	I-5	Review	397
Is that correct?	I-Review	I-5	Review	397

As described in the introduction to our submission, the main goal of our paper is to introduce the Hamiltonian formalism to contemporary machine learning, since it plays a central role in physics, the theory and tools around it have a long history of development and use, and it has properties that many machine learning systems may benefit from, like time reversibility, smooth interpolation in time and conservation of state properties.

[line_break_token][line_break_token]&gt;&gt;&gt; Q1.4) I highly value enlightening small scale experiments and do understand that computational resources are not available everywhere however I think it would benefit the paper greatly if the proposed method is demonstrated on some reasonably sized dataset (at the very least one of full MNIST, Fashion MNIST, FreyFaces).

The paper introduces an efficient, unbiased contrastive divergence-like algorithm for training energy-based generative models on the example of Restricted Boltzmann Machine.	O	O	Review	372
[line_break_token]The proposed algorithm is built upon a very interesting work on unbiased finite-step MCMC approximations by Jacob et al, 2017.	O	O	Review	372
[line_break_token]Despite the actual theory being published some time ago, the submitted paper popularises these ideas in the machine learning community and contains optimised variants of the existing algorithms for training of RBMs.	O	O	Review	372
[line_break_token][line_break_token]The paper is mostly written well and does a good job of introducing unbiased MCMC estimators.	O	O	Review	372

[line_break_token]It also appears that the algorithm actually does not require too many steps and generally does not introduce a lot of computational overhead.	O	O	Review	372

[line_break_token]I would be interested in its performance for different number of steps including the dynamically chosen number provided by the empirical \tau in UCD for a given iteration.	I-Review	I-1	Review	372
[line_break_token]Even though I do not expect a significant improvement to be obtained, this would separate the effect of the number of steps chosen ‚Äúright‚Äù from unbiasedness of the gradient estimator.	B-Review	B-2	Review	372

The paper proposes an algorithmic improvement that significantly simplifies training of energy-based models, such as the Restricted Boltzmann Machine.	O	O	Review	372
The key issue in training such models is computing the gradient of the log partition function, which can be framed as computing the expected value of f(x) = dE(x; theta) / d theta over the model distribution p(x).	O	O	Review	372
The canonical algorithm for this problem is Contrastive Divergence which approximates x ~ p(x) with k steps of Gibbs sampling, resulting in biased gradients.	O	O	Review	372
In this paper, the authors apply the recently introduced unbiased MCMC framework of Jacob et al to completely remove the bias.	O	O	Review	372
The key idea is to (1) rewrite the expectation as a limit of a telescopic sum: E f(x_0) + \sum_t E f(x_t) - E f(x_{t-1}); (2) run two coupled MCMC chains, one for the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù part of the telescopic sum and one for the ‚Äúnegative‚Äù part until they converge.	O	O	Review	372
After convergence, all remaining terms of the sum are zero and we can stop iterating.	O	O	Review	372
However, the number of time steps until convergence is now random.	O	O	Review	372

The proof of finite computation time and variance is very nice to have.	O	O	Review	372
