### Benchmark Performance

Empirically, although `ADAM` optimizer converges faster, we found that using `SGD` with learning rate of `0.01` and `100` epochs is better than `ADAM`.

* Experiments on the CoNLL-2003 dataset
    
    | Model| Dataset | Precision | Recall | F1 |
    |-------| ------- | :---------: | :------: | :--: |
    |Lample et al., (2016)| Dev Set | - | -|-|
    |This Implementation (on GPU)| Dev Set | 94.99 | 94.85 |94.92|
    |Lample et al., (2016)| Test Set | - | -|90.94|
    |This Implementation (on GPU)| Test Set | 91.30  | 91.41 |**91.36**|
    | This Implementation +ELMo| Test Set | 92.4  | 92.2 |**92.3**|

* Experiments on the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset
    Since the dataset statistics is usually not clear in many literatures. We take a lot efforts to find the standard splits in the following table. 
    
    |  | #Sent | #Entity | #Token | 
    |---|:----:|:----:|:----:|
    |Train|59,924 | 81,828|1,088,503|
    |Dev|8,528 | 11,066|147,724|
    |Test|8,262 | 11,257|152,728|
    
    The above statistics follow most of the paper that have dataset statistics table presented (Chiu and Nichols, 2016; Li et al., 2017; Ghaddar and Langlais, 2018;). 

    **Dataset Preprocessing**: We found that most of the papers are not describing the data splits in details and there are two different ways to create the dataset.
    The preprocessing scripts can be either found in http://conll.cemantix.org/2012/data.html or http://cemantix.org/data/ontonotes.html.
    However, one problem is no matter how you preprocess the data using either one of this scripts, you could not get the exact data splits as in the above table (i.e., you
    could not obtain the exact splits as many literatures).

    **How to get the correct splits?** We found that we should use the train/dev splits with the preprocessing scripts from http://conll.cemantix.org/2012/data.html and use the test split with the
    preprocessing scripts from http://cemantix.org/data/ontonotes.html. Then you will obtain the above exact data splits.

    The benchmark performance (without contextualized embeddings):
    
    | Model| Dataset | Precision | Recall | F1 |
    |-------| ------- | :---------: | :------: | :--: |
    |LSTM-CNN (Chiu and Nichols, 2016)| Test Set | - | -|86.17|
    |BiLSTM-CRF (Our Implementation on GPU)| Test Set | 87.85 | 86.84 |**87.34**|
    | Our Implementation  +ELMo| Test Set | 89.14| 88.59 |**88.87**|
    |LSTM-CNN + lexicon (Chiu and Nichols, 2016)*| Test Set | - | -|86.28|
    |BRNN-CNN with parse tree (Li et al., 2017)*| Test Set | 88.0 | 86.5|87.21| 
    |BiLSTM-CRF + Robust Features (Ghaddar and Langlais, 2018)*| Test Set | - | -|87.95| 
    
    \* indicates they use external features besides word embeddings. 
    The results can be reproduced by simply changing the dataset from `conll2003` to `ontonotes`.
